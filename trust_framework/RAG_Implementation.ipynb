BUSINESS\\nOverview\\nWe design, develop, manufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems, and offer services related to our products. We generally sell our products directly to customers, and continue to grow our customer-facing infrastructure through a global network of vehicle showrooms and service centers, Mobile Service, body shops, Supercharger stations and Destination Chargers to\\naccelerate the widespread adoption of our products. We emphasize performance, attractive styling and the safety of our users and workforce in the design and manufacture of our products and are continuing to develop full self-driving technology for improved safety. We also strive to lower the cost of ownership for our customers through continuous efforts to reduce manufacturing costs and by offering financial and other services tailored to\\nour products.\\nOur mission is to accelerate the world‚Äôs transition to sustainable energy. We believe that this mission, along with our engineering expertise, vertically integrated business model and focus on user experience differentiate us from other companies.\\nSegment Information\\nWe operate as two reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.\\nThe automotive segment includes the design, development, manufacturing, sales and leasing of high-performance fully electric vehicles as well as sales of automotive regulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive segment also includes services and other, which includes sales of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services and collision, part sales, paid Supercharging, insurance services revenue and retail merchandise sales. The\\nenergy generation and storage segment includes the design, manufacture, installation, sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products and related services and sales of solar energy systems incentives.\\nOur Products and Services\\nAutomotive\\nWe currently manufacture five different consumer vehicles ‚Äì the Model 3, Y, S, X and Cybertruck. Model 3 is a four-door mid-size sedan that we designed for manufacturability with a base price for mass-market appeal. Model Y is a compact sport utility vehicle (‚ÄúSUV‚Äù) built on the Model 3 platform with seating for up to seven adults. Model S is a four-door full-size sedan and Model X is a mid-size SUV with seating for up to seven\\nadults. Model S and Model X feature the highest performance characteristics and longest ranges that we offer in a sedan and SUV, respectively. In November 2023, we entered the consumer pickup truck market with first deliveries of the Cybertruck, a full-size electric pickup truck with a stainless steel exterior that has the utility and strength of a truck while featuring the speed of a sports car.\\nIn 2022, we also began early production and deliveries of a commercial electric vehicle, the Tesla Semi. We have planned electric vehicles to address additional vehicle markets, and continue leveraging developments in our proprietary Full Self-Driving (‚ÄúFSD‚Äù) (Supervised) features, including through our purpose-built Robotaxi product - Cybercab, and battery cell and other technologies. For purposes of this filing, use of the term\\n‚ÄúFSD (Supervised)‚Äù includes the equivalent naming convention, ‚ÄúFSD (Capability)‚Äù that is used in the European, Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nEnergy Storage Products\\nPowerwall and Megapack are our lithium-ion battery energy storage products. Powerwall, which we sell directly to customers, as well as through channel partners, is designed to store energy at a home or small commercial facility. Megapack is an energy storage solution for commercial, industrial, utility and energy generation customers, multiple of which may be grouped together to form larger installations of gigawatt hours (‚ÄúGWh‚Äù)\\nor greater capacity.\\nWe also continue to develop software capabilities for remotely controlling and dispatching our energy storage systems across a wide range of markets and applications, including through our real-time energy control and optimization platforms.\\nTable of Contents\\nSolar Energy Offerings\\nWe sell retrofit solar energy systems to customers and channel partners. We purchase most of the components for our retrofit solar energy systems from multiple sources to ensure competitive pricing and adequate supply. We also design and manufacture certain components for our solar energy products.\\nWe sell our Solar Roof, which combines premium glass roof tiles with energy generation, to consumers, including through channel customers. We continue to improve our installation capability and efficiency, including through collaboration with real estate developers and builders on new homes.\\nTechnology\\nAutomotive\\nBattery and Powertrain\\nOur core vehicle technology competencies include powertrain engineering and manufacturing and our ability to design vehicles that utilize the unique advantages of an electric powertrain. We have designed our proprietary powertrain systems to be adaptable, efficient, reliable and cost-effective while withstanding the rigors of an automotive environment. We offer dual motor powertrain vehicles, which use two electric motors to\\nmaximize traction and performance in an all-wheel drive configuration, as well as vehicle powertrain technology featuring three electric motors for further increased performance in certain versions of Model S and Model X, Cybertruck and the Tesla Semi.\\nWe maintain extensive testing and R&D capabilities for battery cells, packs and systems, and have built an expansive body of knowledge on lithium-ion cell chemistry types and performance characteristics. In order to enable a greater supply of cells for our products with higher energy density at lower costs, we have developed a new proprietary lithium-ion battery cell and improved manufacturing processes.\\nVehicle Control and Infotainment Software\\nThe performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs utilize sophisticated control software. Control systems in our vehicles optimize performance, customize vehicle behavior, manage charging and control all infotainment functions. We develop almost all of this software, including most of the user interfaces, internally and update our vehicles‚Äô software regularly through over-the-air updates.\\nSelf-Driving Development and Artificial Intelligence\\nWe have expertise in developing technologies, systems and software to enable self-driving vehicles using primarily vision-based technologies. Our FSD Computer runs our neural networks in our vehicles, and we are also developing additional computer hardware to better enable the massive amounts of field data captured by our vehicles to continually train and improve these neural networks for real-world performance.\\nCurrently, we offer in our vehicles certain advanced driver assist systems under our Autopilot and FSD (Supervised) options. Although at present, same as in the past, the driver is responsible for remaining fully engaged in the driving operation, our systems provide safety and convenience functionality that can relieve drivers of many tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel much like the system that airplane pilots use,\\nwhen conditions permit. As with other vehicle systems, we improve these functions in our vehicles over time through over-the-air software updates.\\nIn 2025, we intend to begin launching our Robotaxi business, a ride-hailing network that will eventually operate fully autonomous vehicles. We expect this business will open access to a new customer base even as modes of transportation evolve. We believe our capabilities and advancements in AI, including the deployment of Cortex, our training cluster at Gigafactory Texas, differentiates us from our competitors.\\nWe are also applying our artificial intelligence learnings from self-driving technology to the field of robotics, such as through Optimus, a robotic humanoid in development, which is controlled by the same AI system.\\nTable of Contents\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nEnergy Storage Products\\nWe leverage many of the component-level technologies from our vehicles in our energy storage products. By taking a modular approach to the design of battery systems, we can optimize manufacturing capacity of our energy storage products. Additionally, our expertise in power electronics enables our battery systems to interconnect with electricity grids while providing fast-acting systems for power injection and absorption. We have\\nalso developed software to remotely control and dispatch our energy storage systems.\\nSolar Energy Systems\\nWe have engineered Solar Roof over numerous iterations to combine aesthetic appeal and durability with power generation. The efficiency of our solar energy products is aided by our own solar inverter, which incorporates our power electronics technologies. We designed both products to integrate with Powerwall.\\nDesign and Engineering\\nAutomotive\\nWe have established significant in-house capabilities in the design and test engineering of electric vehicles and their components and systems. Our team has significant experience in computer-aided design as well as durability, strength and crash test simulations, which reduces the product development time of new models. We have also achieved complex engineering feats in stamping, casting and thermal systems, and developed a\\nmethod to integrate batteries directly with vehicle body structures without separate battery packs to optimize manufacturability, weight, range and cost characteristics.\\nWe are also expanding our manufacturing operations globally while taking action to localize our vehicle designs and production for particular markets, including country-specific market demands and factory optimizations for local workforces. As we increase our capabilities, particularly in the areas of automation, die-making and line-building, we are also making strides in the simulations modeling these capabilities prior to\\nconstruction.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nOur expertise in electrical, mechanical, civil and software engineering allows us to design, engineer, manufacture and install energy generating and storage products and components, including at the residential through utility scale. For example, the modular design of our Megapack utility-scale battery line is intended to significantly reduce the amount of assembly required in the field. We also customize solutions including our energy\\nstorage products, solar energy systems and/or Solar Roof for customers to meet their specific needs.\\nSales and Marketing\\nHistorically, we have been able to achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs. We continue to monitor our public narrative and brand, and tailor our marketing efforts accordingly, including through investments in customer education and advertising as necessary.\\nAutomotive\\nDirect Sales\\nOur vehicle sales channels currently include our website and an international network of company-owned stores. In some jurisdictions, we also have galleries to educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not transact in the sale of vehicles. We believe this infrastructure enables us to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, educate consumers about electric vehicles, make our\\nvehicles more affordable, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand and obtain rapid customer feedback.\\nWe reevaluate our sales strategy both globally and at a location-by-location level from time to time to optimize our sales channels. However, sales of vehicles in the automobile industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to volatility from time to time.\\nTable of Contents\\nUsed Vehicle Sales\\nOur used vehicle business supports new vehicle sales by integrating the trade-in of a customer‚Äôs existing Tesla or non-Tesla vehicle with the sale of a new Tesla vehicle. The Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles we acquire as trade-ins, along with vehicles returned upon lease-end are subsequently remarketed, either directly by us or through third parties.\\nPublic Charging\\nWe have a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers, which are our industrial-grade, high-speed vehicle chargers. Where possible, we co-locate Superchargers with our solar and energy storage systems to reduce costs and promote renewable power. Supercharger stations are typically placed along well-traveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow vehicle owners the ability to enjoy quick, reliable charging along an\\nextensive network with convenient stops. Use of the Supercharger network either requires payment of a fee or is free under certain sales programs. In November 2021, we began to offer Supercharger access to non-Tesla vehicles in certain locations in support of our mission to accelerate the world‚Äôs transition to sustainable energy, and in November 2022, we opened up our previously proprietary charging connector as the North American\\nCharging Standard (NACS). This enables electric vehicles and charging stations to interoperate ‚Äî which makes charging easier and more efficient for everyone and advances our mission to accelerate the world‚Äôs transition to sustainable energy. Following this, all major automotive companies announced their adoption of NACS in certain markets, with their access to the Supercharger network beginning in phases in 2024 and their production\\nof NACS vehicles beginning no later than 2025. We also engaged SAE International to govern NACS as an industry standard, now named J3400. We continue to monitor and increase our network of Tesla Superchargers in anticipation of future demand.\\nWe also work with a wide variety of hospitality, retail and public destinations, as well as businesses with commuting employees, to offer additional charging options for our customers, as well as single-family homeowners and multi-family residential entities, to deploy home charging solutions.\\nIn-App Upgrades\\nAs our vehicles are capable of being updated remotely over-the-air, our customers may purchase additional paid options and features through the Tesla app or through the in-vehicle user interface. We expect that this functionality will also allow us to offer certain options and features on a subscription basis in the future.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nWe market and sell our solar and energy storage products to residential, commercial and industrial customers and utilities through a variety of channels, including through our website, stores and galleries, as well as through our network of channel partners, and in the case of some commercial customers, through PPA transactions. We emphasize simplicity, standardization and accessibility to make it easy and cost-effective for customers\\nto adopt clean energy, while reducing our customer acquisition costs.\\nService and Warranty\\nAutomotive\\nService\\nWe provide service for our electric vehicles at our company-owned service locations and through Tesla Mobile Service technicians who perform work remotely at customers‚Äô homes or other locations. Servicing the vehicles ourselves allows us to identify problems and implement solutions and improvements faster than traditional automobile manufacturers and their dealer networks. The connectivity of our vehicles also allows us to\\ndiagnose and remedy many problems remotely and proactively.\\nVehicle Limited Warranties and Extended Service Plans\\nWe provide a manufacturer‚Äôs limited warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell directly to consumers, which may include limited warranties on certain components, specific types of damage or battery capacity retention. We also currently offer optional extended service plans that provide coverage beyond the new vehicle limited warranties for certain models in specified regions.\\nTable of Contents\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nWe provide service and repairs to our energy product customers, including under warranty where applicable. We generally provide manufacturer‚Äôs limited warranties with our energy storage products and offer certain extended limited warranties that are available at the time of purchase of the system. If we install a system, we also provide certain limited warranties on our installation workmanship.\\nFor retrofit solar energy systems, we provide separate limited warranties for workmanship and against roof leaks, and for Solar Roof, we also provide limited warranties for defects and weatherization. For components not manufactured by us, we generally pass-through the applicable manufacturers‚Äô warranties.\\nAs part of our historical solar energy system and energy storage contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that commit that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or performance requirements specified in the contract.\\nFinancial Services\\nAutomotive\\nPurchase Financing and Leases\\nWe offer leasing and/or loan financing arrangements for our vehicles in certain jurisdictions in North America, Europe and/or Asia ourselves and through various financial institutions. Under certain of such programs, we have provided resale value guarantees or buyback guarantees that may obligate us to cover a resale loss up to a certain limit or repurchase the subject vehicles at pre-determined values.\\nInsurance\\nIn 2021, we launched our insurance product using real-time driving behavior in select states, which offers rates that are often better than other alternatives and promotes safer driving. Our insurance products are currently available in 12 states and we plan to expand the markets in which we offer insurance products, as part of our ongoing effort to decrease the total cost of ownership for our customers.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nWe offer certain financing options to our residential customers, which enable the customer to purchase and own energy systems comprised of solar, Solar Roof and/or Powerwall batteries. Our solar PPAs, offered primarily to commercial customers, charge a fee per kilowatt-hour based on the amount of electricity produced by our solar energy systems.\\nManufacturing\\nWe currently have manufacturing facilities in the U.S. in California, New York, Texas and Nevada. At these facilities, we manufacture and assemble, among other things, vehicles, certain vehicle parts and components, such as our battery packs and battery cells, energy storage components and systems and solar products and components.\\nInternationally, we also have manufacturing facilities in China and Germany, which allows us to increase the affordability of our vehicles for customers in local markets by reducing transportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating the impact of unfavorable tariffs. In March 2023, we announced the location of our next Gigafactory in Monterrey, Mexico. Generally, we continue to expand production capacity at our existing\\nfacilities. We also intend to further increase cost-competitiveness in our significant markets by strategically adding local manufacturing.\\nSupply Chain\\nOur products use thousands of parts that are sourced from hundreds of suppliers across the world. We have developed close relationships with vendors of key parts such as battery cells, electronics and complex vehicle assemblies. Certain components purchased from these suppliers are shared or are similar across many product lines, allowing us to take advantage of pricing efficiencies from economies of scale.\\nTable of Contents\\nAs is the case for some automotive companies, some of our procured components and systems are sourced from single suppliers. Where multiple sources are available for certain key components, we work to qualify multiple suppliers for them where it is sensible to do so in order to minimize potential production risks due to disruptions in their supply. We also mitigate risk by maintaining safety stock for key parts and assemblies and\\ndie banks for components with lengthy procurement lead times.\\nOur products use various raw materials including aluminum, steel, cobalt, lithium, nickel and copper. Pricing for these materials is governed by market conditions and may fluctuate due to various factors outside of our control, such as supply and demand and market speculation. We strive to execute long-term supply contracts for such materials at competitive pricing when feasible, and we currently believe that we have adequate access\\nto raw materials supplies to meet the needs of our operations.\\nGovernmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations\\nGlobally, the ownership of our products by our customers is impacted by various government credits, incentives, and policies. Our business and products are also subject to numerous governmental regulations that vary among jurisdictions.\\nThe operation of our business is also impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\\nPrograms and Incentives\\nInflation Reduction Act\\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (‚ÄúIRA‚Äù) was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022, and remains subject to future guidance releases. The IRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, including through providing tax credits to consumers. For example, under current legislation,\\nqualifying Tesla customers may receive up to $7,500 in federal tax credits for the purchase of qualified electric vehicles in the U.S. through 2032.\\nAutomotive Regulatory Credits\\nWe earn tradable credits in the operation of our business under various regulations related to zero-emission vehicles (‚ÄúZEVs‚Äù), greenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements. Sales of these credits are recognized within automotive regulatory credits revenue in our consolidated statements of\\noperations included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nEnergy Storage System Incentives and Policies\\nWhile the regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development, there are various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms at the federal, state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage.\\nFor example, energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy may be eligible for the solar energy-related U.S. federal tax credits described below. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (‚ÄúFERC‚Äù) has also taken steps to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale energy markets. In addition, California and a number of other states have adopted procurement targets for energy storage, and behind-the-meter\\nenergy storage systems qualify for funding under the California Self Generation Incentive Program. Our customers primarily benefit directly under these programs. In certain instances our customers may transfer such credits to us as contract consideration. In such transactions, they are included as a component of energy generation and storage revenues in our consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this Annual Report on\\nForm 10-K.\\nPursuant to the IRA, under Sections 48, 48E and 25D of the Internal Revenue Code (‚ÄùIRC‚Äù), standalone energy storage technology is eligible for a tax credit between 6% and 50% of qualified expenditures, regardless of the source of energy, which may be claimed by our customers for storage systems they purchase or by us for arrangements where we own the systems. These tax credits are primarily for the benefit of our customers and\\nare currently scheduled to phase-out starting in 2032 or later.\\nTable of Contents\\nSolar Energy System Incentives and Policies\\nU.S. federal, state and local governments have established various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy. These incentives include tax credits, cash grants, tax abatements and rebates.\\nIn particular, pursuant to the IRA, Sections 48, 48E and 25D of the IRC provides a tax credit between 6% and 70% of qualified commercial or residential expenditures for solar energy systems, which may be claimed by our customers for systems they purchase, or by us for arrangements where we own the systems for properties that meet statutory requirements. These tax credits are primarily for the direct benefit of our customers and\\nare currently scheduled to phase-out starting in 2032 or later.\\nRegulations\\nVehicle Safety and Testing\\nIn the U.S., our vehicles are subject to regulation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (‚ÄúNHTSA‚Äù), including all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (‚ÄúFMVSS‚Äù) and the NHTSA bumper standard. Numerous FMVSS apply to our vehicles, such as crash-worthiness and occupant protection requirements. Our current vehicles fully comply and we expect that our vehicles in the future will fully comply\\nwith all applicable FMVSS with limited or no exemptions; however, FMVSS are subject to change from time to time. As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that our vehicles meet all applicable FMVSS and the NHTSA bumper standard, or otherwise are exempt, before the vehicles may be imported or sold in the U.S.\\nWe are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, Theft Prevention Act requirements, labeling requirements and other information provided to customers in writing, Early Warning Reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls, a Standing General Order requiring reports regarding\\ncertain crashes involving vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance systems, and additional requirements for cooperating with compliance and safety investigations and recall reporting. The U.S. Automobile Information and Disclosure Act also requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer‚Äôs suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, federal law requires\\ninclusion of fuel economy ratings, as determined by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency (the ‚ÄúEPA‚Äù), and New Car Assessment Program ratings as determined by NHTSA, if available.\\nOur vehicles sold outside of the U.S. are subject to similar foreign compliance, safety, environmental and other regulations. Many of those regulations are different from those applicable in the U.S. and may require redesign and/or retesting. Some of those regulations impact or prevent the rollout of new vehicle features.\\nSelf-Driving Vehicles\\nGenerally, laws pertaining to self-driving vehicles are evolving globally, and in some cases may create restrictions on features or vehicle designs that we develop. While there are currently no federal U.S. regulations pertaining specifically to self-driving vehicles or self-driving equipment, NHTSA has published recommended guidelines on self-driving vehicles, apart from the FMVSS and manufacturer reporting obligations, and retains\\nthe authority to investigate and/or take action on the safety or compliance of any vehicle, equipment or features operating on public roads. Certain U.S. states also have legal restrictions on the operation, registration or licensure of self-driving vehicles, and many other states are considering them. This regulatory patchwork increases the legal complexity with respect to self-driving vehicles in the U.S.\\nIn markets that follow the regulations of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (‚ÄúECE markets‚Äù), some requirements restrict the design of advanced driver-assistance or self-driving features, which can compromise or prevent their use entirely. Other applicable laws, both current and proposed, may hinder or complicate the path and timeline to introducing self-driving vehicles for sale and use in the markets where they\\napply.\\nOther key markets, including China, continue to consider self-driving regulation. Any implemented regulations may differ materially from the U.S. and ECE markets, which may further increase the legal complexity of self-driving vehicles and limit or prevent certain features.\\nTable of Contents\\nAutomobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation\\nIn the U.S., state laws regulate the manufacture, distribution, sale and service of automobiles, and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to residents. Certain states have asserted that the laws in such states do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer, or that they otherwise restrict a manufacturer‚Äôs ability to deliver\\nor perform warranty repairs on vehicles. To sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer, we generally conduct the sale out of the state. In certain such states, we have opened ‚Äúgalleries‚Äù that serve an educational purpose and where sales may not occur.\\nSome automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used administrative and legislative processes to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations. Certain dealer associations have also actively lobbied state licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to our ownership and operation\\nof our own retail and service locations. We expect such challenges to continue, and we intend to actively fight any such efforts.\\nBattery Safety and Testing\\nOur battery packs are subject to various U.S. and international regulations that govern transport of ‚Äúdangerous goods,‚Äù defined to include lithium-ion batteries, which may present a risk in transportation. We conduct testing to demonstrate our compliance with such regulations.\\nWe use lithium-ion cells in our high voltage battery packs in our vehicles and energy storage products. The use, storage and disposal of our battery packs are regulated under existing laws and are the subject of ongoing regulatory changes that may add additional requirements in the future. We have agreements with third party battery recycling companies to recycle our battery packs, and we are also piloting our own recycling\\ntechnology.\\nSolar Energy‚ÄîGeneral\\nWe are subject to certain state and federal regulations applicable to solar and battery storage providers and sellers of electricity. To operate our systems, we enter into standard interconnection agreements with applicable utilities. Sales of electricity and non-sale equipment leases by third parties, such as our leases and PPAs, have faced regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions.\\nSolar Energy‚ÄîNet Metering\\nMost states in the U.S. make net energy metering, or net metering, available to solar customers. Net metering typically allows solar customers to interconnect their solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit for excess energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid. In certain jurisdictions, regulators or utilities have reduced or eliminated the\\nbenefit available under net metering or have proposed to do so.\\nCompetition\\nAutomotive\\nThe worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future as a significant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered, or are reported to have plans to enter the electric vehicle market.\\nWe believe that our vehicles compete in the market based on both their traditional segment classification as well as their propulsion technology. For example, Cybertruck competes with other pickup trucks, Model S and Model X compete primarily with premium sedans and premium SUVs and Model 3 and Model Y compete with small to medium-sized sedans and compact SUVs, all of which are extremely competitive markets.\\nCompeting products typically include internal combustion vehicles from more established automobile manufacturers; however, many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles. Overall, we believe these announcements and vehicle introductions promote the development of the electric vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness\\nof electric vehicles relative to internal combustion vehicles. Many major automobile manufacturers have electric vehicles available today in major markets including the U.S., China and Europe, and other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are also developing electric vehicles. In addition, several manufacturers offer hybrid vehicles, including plug-in versions.\\nTable of Contents\\nWe believe that there is also increasing competition for our vehicle offerings as a platform for delivering self-driving technologies, charging solutions and other features and services, and we expect to compete in this developing market through continued progress on our Autopilot, FSD (Supervised) and neural network capabilities, Supercharger network and our infotainment offerings.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nEnergy Storage Systems\\nThe market for energy storage products is also highly competitive, and both established and emerging companies have introduced products that are similar to our product portfolio or that are alternatives to the elements of our systems. We compete with these companies based on price, energy density and efficiency. We believe that the specifications and features of our products, our strong brand and the modular, scalable nature of our\\nenergy storage products give us a competitive advantage in our markets.\\nSolar Energy Systems\\nThe primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our potential customers. We compete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems. We also compete with solar energy companies that provide products and services similar to ours. Many solar energy\\ncompanies only install solar energy systems, while others only provide financing for these installations. We believe we have a significant expansion opportunity with our offerings and that the regulatory environment is increasingly conducive to the adoption of renewable energy systems.\\nIntellectual Property\\nWe place a strong emphasis on our innovative approach and proprietary designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to our product portfolio. As part of our business, we seek to protect the underlying intellectual property rights of these innovations and designs such as with respect to patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, confidential information and other measures, including through employee and third-party\\nnondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements. For example, we place a high priority on obtaining patents to provide the broadest and strongest possible protection to enable our freedom to operate our innovations and designs across all of our products and technologies as well as to protect and defend our product portfolio. We have also adopted a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit\\nagainst any party for infringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith. We made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common, rapidly-evolving platform for electric vehicles, thereby benefiting ourselves, other companies making electric vehicles and the world.\\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Human Capital Resources\\nESG\\nThe very purpose of Tesla\\'s existence is to accelerate the world\\'s transition to sustainable energy. We believe the world cannot reduce carbon emissions without addressing both energy generation and consumption, and we are designing and manufacturing a complete energy and transportation ecosystem to achieve this goal. As we expand, we are building each new factory to be more efficient and sustainably designed than the previous\\none, including with respect to per-unit waste reduction and resource consumption, including water and energy usage. We are focused on further enhancing sustainability of operations outside of our direct control, including reducing the carbon footprint of our supply chain.\\nWe are committed to sourcing only responsibly produced materials, and our suppliers are required to provide evidence of management systems that ensure social, environmental and sustainability best practices in their own operations, as well as to demonstrate a commitment to responsible sourcing into their supply chains. We have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to child or forced labor and human trafficking by our suppliers and\\nwe look to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidelines to inform our process and use feedback from our internal and external stakeholders to find ways to continually improve. We are also driving safety in our own factories by focusing on worker engagement. Our incidents per vehicle continue to drop even as our production volumes increase. We also strive to be an employer of choice by offering\\ncompelling, impactful jobs with best in-industry benefits.\\nTable of Contents\\nWe believe that sound corporate governance is critical to helping us achieve our goals, including with respect to ESG. We continue to evolve a governance framework that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the company and manages its affairs consistent with high principles of business ethics. Our Sustainability and Impact team, in conjunction with leaders from across our Company, regularly\\npresents to our Board of Directors, which oversees our ESG impacts, initiatives and priorities.\\nHuman Capital Resources\\nTesla‚Äôs ability to attract, develop and retain a talented workforce is a competitive advantage.

Trainees have the unique opportunity to experience all key aspects of service, sales and delivery within a single 12-month program, before making an informed decision on which career path they\\'d like to specialize in full-time upon completion. The program is ideal for exploring careers within Tesla‚Äôs service\\nteam.\\n‚Ä¢START (Manufacturing and Service) ‚Äì Tesla START is an intensive training program that equips individuals with the skills needed for a successful technician role at Tesla. We partner with colleges to integrate Tesla START into automotive and manufacturing classroom locations. In 2024, Tesla START expanded to 14 campuses and hired over 400 technicians.\\nTesla is committed to providing a workplace where employees feel respected, satisfied and appreciated. Our policies are designed to promote fairness and respect for everyone. We actively support the hiring, retention and advancement of exceptional talent, including but not limited to veterans, disabled veterans and individuals with disabilities. As of December 31, 2024, in the US, 2.3% of our employees are veterans or active-duty\\nmilitary personnel, 3.3% of our employees are identify as individuals with disabilities and 1.2% of our employees identify as veterans or active-duty military personnel with disabilities. Our military partnerships and development programs noted above help to directly and indirectly support these employees.\\nAt Tesla, our employees‚Äô passion is what powers our mission. Everyone is expected to be trustworthy, demonstrate excellence in their performance and collaborate with others. Our factories, offices, stores and service centers are places where our employees have opportunities to enhance their skills and gain experience, which is essential for Tesla‚Äôs growth.\\nTable of Contents\\nWith this in mind, we will not tolerate certain behaviors. These include harassment, retaliation, violence, intimidation and discrimination of any kind based on any protected category or action. Anti-harassment training is provided to all new hires on their first day of orientation, ensuring that all employees are equipped with the knowledge and tools to maintain a respectful environment. For leaders, anti-harassment training is reinforced\\non an ongoing basis to promote consistent leadership standards and reinforce organizational values.\\nIn addition to anti-harassment training, we offer a range of leadership development programs throughout the year to further enhance leaders\\' skills. These programs are designed to help leaders manage teams, communicate effectively, drive a culture of accountability and resolve disputes.\\nAt Tesla, we listen to our employees. Our engagement strategy is to listen, act and report back to employees on progress. Pulse, Tesla\\'s semiannual employee survey, aims to capture the employee experience and generated 86% global participation. The crucial feedback garnered from these efforts helps shape Tesla‚Äôs future goals, plans and projects.\\nThe safety and health of our employees is a core value. Everyone across Tesla works to ensure a healthy and safe workplace. Employees are encouraged to speak up regarding misconduct or safety concerns and can do so by contacting the integrity line, submitting concerns through our Take Charge process, or notifying their Human Resource Partner or any member of management. Concerns are reviewed in accordance with established\\nprotocols by investigators with expertise, who also review for trends and outcomes for remediation and appropriate controls. Responding to questions timely is key so Human Resource Partners for each functional area are visible throughout facilities and engaging employees.\\nOur Compensation Committee generally oversees our human capital management strategy, and regularly receives updates and reviews certain management practices related to Tesla‚Äôs talent, including how Tesla recruits, develops and retains excellent talent. The Committee directly interacts and engages with members of Tesla‚Äôs management, including members from the human resources, compliance and legal teams to review and\\nevaluate people-related initiatives, employee feedback, risks and opportunities.

RISK FACTORS\\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and\\noperating results.\\nRisks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business\\nWe may experience delays in launching and ramping the production of our products and features, or we may be unable to control our manufacturing costs.\\nWe have previously experienced and may in the future experience launch and production ramp delays for new products and features. For example, we encountered unanticipated supplier issues that led to delays during the initial ramp of our first Model X and experienced challenges with a supplier and with ramping full automation for certain of our initial Model 3 manufacturing processes. In addition, we may introduce in the future\\nnew or unique manufacturing processes and design features for our products. As we expand our vehicle offerings and global footprint, there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully and timely introduce and scale such processes or features.\\nTable of Contents\\nIn particular, our future business depends in large part on increasing the production of mass-market vehicles. In order to be successful, we will need to implement, maintain and ramp efficient and cost-effective manufacturing capabilities, processes and supply chains and achieve the design tolerances, high quality and output rates we have planned at our manufacturing facilities in California, Nevada, Texas, China, Germany and any\\nfuture sites such as Mexico. We will also need to hire, train and compensate skilled employees to operate these facilities. Bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges such as those we experienced in the past may arise during our production ramps, and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve manufacturing processes and reducing costs. If we are not successful in achieving these goals, we could face delays in establishing\\nand/or sustaining our product ramps or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability targets.\\nWe have experienced, and may also experience similar future delays in launching and/or ramping production of our energy storage products and Solar Roof; new product versions or variants; new vehicles; and future products, features and services based on artificial intelligence. Likewise, we may encounter delays with the design, construction and regulatory or other approvals necessary to build and bring online future manufacturing\\nfacilities and products. In addition, as we continue to develop our artificial intelligence services and products, we may face many additional challenges, including the availability and cost of energy, processing power limitations and the substantial power requirements for our data centers.\\nAny delay or other complication in ramping the production of our current products or the development, manufacture, launch and production ramp of our future products, features and services, or in doing so cost-effectively and with high quality, may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\\nOur suppliers may fail to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes that are acceptable to us, or we may be unable to manage these components effectively.\\nOur products contain thousands of parts purchased globally from hundreds of suppliers, including single-source direct suppliers, which exposes us to multiple potential sources of component shortages. Unexpected changes in business conditions, materials pricing, including inflation of raw material costs, labor issues, wars, trade policies, natural disasters, health epidemics, trade and shipping disruptions, port congestions, cyberattacks\\nand other factors beyond our or our suppliers‚Äô control could also affect these suppliers‚Äô ability to deliver technologies or components to us or to remain solvent and operational. Additionally, if our suppliers do not accurately forecast and effectively allocate production or if they are not willing to allocate sufficient production to us, or face other challenges such as insolvency, it may reduce our access to components and require us to search for\\nnew suppliers. The unavailability of any component or supplier could result in production delays, idle manufacturing facilities, product design changes and loss of access to important technology and tools for producing and supporting our products, as well as impact our capacity expansion and our ability to fulfill our obligations under customer contracts. Moreover, significant increases in our production or product design changes by us have\\nrequired and may in the future require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time. We have faced in the past, and may face suppliers who are unwilling or unable to sustainably meet our timelines or our cost, quality and volume needs, which may increase our costs or require us to replace them with other sources. Finally, as we construct new manufacturing facilities and add production lines to existing facilities, we may\\nexperience issues in correspondingly increasing the level of localized procurement at those facilities. While we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources or develop our own replacements for most of our components, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so quickly or at all. Additionally, we may be unsuccessful in our continuous efforts to negotiate with existing suppliers to obtain cost reductions and avoid\\nunfavorable changes to terms, source less expensive suppliers for certain parts and redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce, especially in the case of increases in materials pricing. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\\nAs the scale of our vehicle production increases, we will also need to accurately forecast, purchase, warehouse and transport components at high volumes to our manufacturing facilities and servicing locations internationally. If we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our actual needs or successfully implement automation, inventory management and other systems to accommodate the\\nincreased complexity in our supply chain and parts management, we may incur unexpected production disruption, storage, transportation and write-off costs, which may harm our business and operating results.\\nWe may be unable to meet our projected construction timelines, costs and production ramps at new factories, or we may experience difficulties in generating and maintaining demand for products manufactured there.\\nOur ability to increase production of our vehicles on a sustained basis, make them affordable globally by accessing local supply chains and workforces and streamline delivery logistics is dependent on the construction and ramp of our current and future factories. The construction of and commencement and ramp of production at these factories are subject\\nTable of Contents\\nto a number of uncertainties inherent in all new manufacturing operations, including ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements, procurement and maintenance of construction, environmental and operational licenses and approvals for additional expansion, supply chain constraints, hiring, training and retention of qualified employees and the pace of bringing production equipment and processes online with the capability to manufacture\\nhigh-quality units at scale. Moreover, we will have to establish and ramp production of our proprietary battery cells and packs at our new factories, and we additionally intend to incorporate sequential design and manufacturing changes into vehicles manufactured at each new factory. If we experience any issues or delays in meeting our projected timelines, costs, capital efficiency and production capacity for our new factories, expanding and\\nmanaging teams to implement iterative design and production changes there, maintaining and complying with the terms of any debt financing that we obtain to fund them or generating and maintaining demand for the vehicles we manufacture there, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition may be harmed.\\nWe may be unable to grow our global product sales, delivery and installation capabilities and our servicing and vehicle charging networks, or we may be unable to accurately project and effectively manage our growth.\\nOur success will depend on our ability to continue to expand our sales capabilities. We are targeting a global mass demographic with a broad range of potential customers, in which we have relatively limited experience projecting demand and pricing our products. We currently produce numerous international variants at a limited number of factories, and if our specific demand expectations for these variants prove inaccurate, we may not\\nbe able to timely generate deliveries matched to the vehicles that we produce in the same timeframe or that are commensurate with the size of our operations in a given region. Likewise, as we develop and grow our energy products and services worldwide, our success will depend on our ability to correctly forecast demand in various markets.\\nBecause we do not have independent dealer networks, we are responsible for delivering all of our vehicles to our customers. As our production volumes continue to grow, we have faced in the past, and may face challenges with deliveries at increasing volumes, particularly in international markets requiring significant transit times. We have also deployed a number of delivery models, such as deliveries to customers‚Äô homes and\\nworkplaces and touchless deliveries, but there is no guarantee that such models will be scalable or be accepted globally. Likewise, as we ramp our energy products, we are working to substantially increase our production and installation capabilities. If we experience production delays or inaccurately forecast demand, our business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\\nMoreover, because of our unique expertise with our vehicles, we recommend that our vehicles be serviced by us or by certain authorized professionals. If we experience delays in adding servicing capacity or servicing our vehicles efficiently, or experience unforeseen issues with the reliability of our vehicles, particularly higher-volume additions to our fleet such as Model 3 and Model Y, it could overburden our servicing capabilities and\\nparts inventory. Similarly, the increasing number of Tesla vehicles also requires us to continue to rapidly increase the number of our Supercharger stations and connectors throughout the world.\\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to ramp our business to meet our sales, delivery, installation, servicing and vehicle charging targets globally, that our projections on which such targets are based will prove accurate or that the pace of growth or coverage of our customer infrastructure network will meet customer expectations. These plans require significant cash investments and management resources and there is no guarantee\\nthat they will generate additional sales or installations of our products, or that we will be able to avoid cost overruns or be able to hire additional personnel to support them. As we expand, we will also need to ensure our compliance with regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions applicable to the sale, installation and servicing of our products, the sale or dispatch of electricity related to our energy products and the operation of\\nSuperchargers. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, it may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\\nWe will need to maintain and significantly grow our access to battery cells, including through the development and manufacture of our own cells, and control our related costs.\\nWe are dependent on the continued supply of lithium-ion battery cells for our vehicles and energy storage products, and we will require substantially more cells to grow our business according to our plans. Currently, we rely on suppliers such as Panasonic and Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL) for these cells. We have to date fully qualified only a very limited number of such suppliers and have limited flexibility\\nin changing suppliers. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from our suppliers could limit production of our vehicles and energy storage products. In the long term, we intend to supplement cells from our suppliers with cells manufactured by us, which we believe will be more efficient, manufacturable at greater volumes and more cost-effective than currently available cells. However, our efforts to develop and manufacture such battery\\ncells have required, and may continue to require, significant investments, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these targets in the timeframes that we have planned or at all. If we are\\nTable of Contents\\nunable to do so, we may have to curtail our planned vehicle and energy storage product production or procure additional cells from suppliers at potentially greater costs, either of which may harm our business and operating results.\\nIn addition, the cost and mass production of battery cells, whether manufactured by our suppliers or by us, depends in part upon the prices and availability of raw materials such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and/or other metals. The prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable, depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials. For example, as a result of increased global production of\\nelectric vehicles and energy storage products, suppliers of these raw materials may be unable to meet our volume needs. Additionally, our suppliers may not be willing or able to reliably meet our timelines or our cost and quality needs, which may require us to replace them with other sources. Any reduced availability of these materials may impact our access to cells and our growth, and any increases in their prices may reduce our profitability\\nif we cannot recoup such costs through increased prices. Moreover, our inability to meet demand and any product price increases may harm our brand, growth, prospects and operating results.\\nOur future growth and success are dependent upon consumers‚Äô demand for electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles in an automotive industry that is generally competitive, cyclical and volatile.\\nThough we continue to see increased interest and adoption of electric vehicles, if the market for electric vehicles in general and Tesla vehicles in particular does not develop as we expect, develops more slowly than we expect, or if demand for our vehicles decreases in our markets or our vehicles compete with each other, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\\nIn addition, electric vehicles still constitute a small percentage of overall vehicle sales. As a result, the market for our vehicles could be negatively affected by numerous factors, such as:\\n‚Ä¢perceptions about electric vehicle features, quality, safety, performance and cost;\\n‚Ä¢perceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge, and access to charging facilities;\\n‚Ä¢competition, including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and high fuel-economy internal combustion engine vehicles;\\n‚Ä¢volatility in the cost of oil, gasoline and energy;\\n‚Ä¢government regulations and economic incentives and conditions; and\\n‚Ä¢concerns about our future viability.\\nThe target demographics for our vehicles are highly competitive. Sales of vehicles in the automotive industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to further volatility. We also cannot predict the duration or direction of current global trends or their sustained impact on consumer demand. Ultimately, we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as\\nappropriate, and attempt to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production, workforce and other resources accordingly. Rising interest rates may lead to consumers to increasingly pull back spending, including on our products, which may harm our demand, business and operating results. If we experience unfavorable global market conditions, or if we cannot or do not maintain operations at a\\nscope that is commensurate with such conditions or are later required to or choose to suspend such operations again, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\\nWe face strong competition for our products and services from a growing list of established and new competitors.\\nThe worldwide automotive market is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future. A significant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered, or are reported to have plans to enter, the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, as well as the market for self-\\ndriving technology and other vehicle applications and software platforms. In some cases, our competitors offer or will offer electric vehicles in important markets such as China and Europe, and/or have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively at some point in the future. In addition, certain government and economic incentives which provide benefits to manufacturers who assemble domestically or have local suppliers,\\nmay provide a greater benefit to our competitors, which could negatively impact our profitability. Many of our competitors have significantly more or better-established resources than we do to devote to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Increased competition could result in our lower vehicle unit sales, price reductions, revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market\\nshare, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\\nTable of Contents\\nWe also face competition in our energy generation and storage business from other manufacturers, developers, installers and service providers of competing energy technologies, as well as from large utilities. In addition, decreases in the retail or wholesale prices of electricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of customer defaults.\\nRisks Related to Our Operations\\nWe may experience issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at our Gigafactories, which may harm the production and profitability of our vehicle and energy storage products.\\nOur plan to grow the volume and profitability of our vehicles and energy storage products depends on significant lithium-ion battery cell production, including by our partner Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada. We also produce several vehicle components at our Gigafactories, such as battery modules and packs and drive units, and manufacture energy storage products. If we are unable to or otherwise do not maintain and grow our\\nrespective operations, or if we are unable to do so cost-effectively or hire and retain highly-skilled personnel there, our ability to manufacture our products profitably would be limited, which may harm our business and operating results.\\nFinally, the high volumes of lithium-ion cells and battery modules and packs manufactured by us and by our suppliers are stored and recycled at our various facilities. Any mishandling of these products may cause disruption to the operation of such facilities. While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our\\noperations. Any such disruptions or issues may harm our brand and business.\\nWe face risks associated with maintaining and expanding our international operations, including unfavorable and uncertain regulatory, political, economic, tax and labor conditions.\\nWe are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, political uncertainty and social, environmental and economic conditions in numerous jurisdictions, including markets in which we generate significant sales, over which we have little control and which are inherently unpredictable. Our operations in such jurisdictions, particularly as a company based in the U.S., with additional manufacturing operations in China and Europe, create\\nrisks relating to conforming our products to regulatory and safety requirements and charging and other electric infrastructures; organizing local operating entities; establishing, staffing and managing foreign business locations; attracting local customers; navigating foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements; enforceability of our contractual rights; trade restrictions, customs regulations, tariffs and price or exchange controls;\\nand preferences in foreign nations for domestically manufactured products. For example, we monitor tax legislation changes on a global basis, including changes arising as a result of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development‚Äôs multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address base erosion and profit shifting. Such conditions may increase our costs, impact our ability to sell our products and require significant management\\nattention, and may harm our business if we are unable to manage them effectively.\\nOur business may suffer if our products or features contain defects, fail to perform as expected or take longer than expected to become fully functional.\\nIf our products contain design or manufacturing defects, whether relating to our software or hardware, that cause them not to perform as designed or intended or that require repair, or certain features of our vehicles such as new Autopilot or FSD (Supervised) features take longer than expected to become enabled, are legally restricted or become subject to onerous regulation, our ability to develop, market and sell our products and\\nservices may be harmed, and we may experience delivery delays, product recalls, allegations of product liability, breach of warranty and related consumer protection claims and significant warranty and other expenses. While we are continuously working to develop and improve our products‚Äô capability and performance, there is no guarantee that any incremental changes in the specific software or equipment we deploy in our vehicles over\\ntime will not result in initial functional disparities from prior iterations or will perform as forecast in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all. Although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our products as effectively and rapidly as possible, such efforts may not be timely, may hamper production or may not completely satisfy our customers. We have performed, and continue to perform, extensive internal testing on our products and\\nfeatures, though, like the rest of the industry, we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate certain aspects of their long-term quality, reliability, durability and performance characteristics, including exposure to or consequence of external attacks. While we attempt to identify and address or remedy defects we identify pre-production and sale, there may be latent defects that we may be unable to detect or control for in our\\nproducts, and thereby address, prior to their sale to or installation for customers.\\nTable of Contents\\nWe may be required to defend or insure against product liability claims.\\nThe automobile industry generally experiences significant product liability claims, and as such we face the risk of such claims in the event our vehicles do not perform or are claimed to not have performed as expected. As is true for other automakers, our vehicles have been involved and we expect in the future will be involved in accidents resulting in death or personal injury, and such accidents where Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot or\\nFSD (Supervised) features are engaged are the subject of significant public attention, especially in light of NHTSA‚Äôs Standing General Order requiring reports regarding certain crashes involving vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems. We have experienced, and we expect to continue to face, claims and regulatory scrutiny arising from or related to misuse or claimed failures or alleged misrepresentations of such new technologies that\\nwe are pioneering. In addition, the battery packs that we produce make use of lithium-ion cells. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells. While we have designed our battery packs to passively contain any single cell‚Äôs release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells, there can be no\\nassurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur, in particular due to a high-speed crash. Likewise, as our solar energy systems and energy storage products generate and store electricity, they have the potential to fail or cause injury to people or property. Any product liability claim may subject us to lawsuits and substantial monetary damages, product recalls or redesign efforts, and\\neven a meritless claim may require us to defend it, all of which may generate negative publicity and be expensive and time-consuming. In most jurisdictions, we generally self-insure against the risk of product liability claims for vehicle exposure, meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds and not by insurance.\\nWe will need to maintain public credibility and confidence in our long-term business prospects in order to succeed.\\nIn order to maintain and grow our business, we must maintain credibility and confidence among customers, suppliers, analysts, investors, ratings agencies and other parties in our long-term financial viability and business prospects. Maintaining such confidence may be challenging due to our limited operating history relative to established competitors; customer unfamiliarity with our products; any delays we may experience in scaling\\nmanufacturing, delivery and service operations to meet demand; competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services; our quarterly production and sales performance compared with market expectations; and other factors including those over which we have no control. In particular, Tesla‚Äôs products, business, results of operations, and statements and actions of Tesla and its management are\\nsubject to significant amounts of commentary by a range of third parties. Such attention can include criticism, which may be exaggerated or unfounded, such as speculation regarding the sufficiency or stability of our management team. Any such negative perceptions, whether caused by us or not, may harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed.\\nWe may be unable to effectively grow, or manage the compliance, residual value, financing and credit risks related to, our various financing programs.\\nWe offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in North America, Europe and Asia primarily ourselves and through various financial institutions. We also currently offer vehicle financing arrangements directly through our local subsidiaries in certain markets. Depending on the country, such arrangements are available for specified models and may include operating leases directly with us under which we typically receive only a very\\nsmall portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease, followed by a stream of payments over the term of the lease. We have also offered various arrangements for customers of our solar energy systems whereby they pay us a fixed payment to lease or finance the purchase of such systems or purchase electricity generated by them. If we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national, state and/or local financial\\nregulations and consumer protection laws governing these transactions, we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties.\\nThe profitability of any directly-leased vehicles returned to us at the end of their leases depends on our ability to accurately project our vehicles‚Äô residual values at the outset of the leases, and such values may fluctuate prior to the end of their terms depending on various factors such as supply and demand of our used vehicles, economic cycles, legislative changes and the pricing of new vehicles. We have made in the past and may make\\nin the future certain adjustments to our prices from time to time in the ordinary course of business, which may impact the residual values of our vehicles and reduce the profitability of our vehicle leasing program. The funding and growth of this program also rely on our ability to secure adequate financing and/or business partners. If we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program through internal funds, partners or other financing\\nsources, and compelling alternative financing programs are not available for our customers who may expect or need such options, we may be unable to grow our vehicle deliveries. Furthermore, if our vehicle leasing business grows substantially, our business may suffer if we cannot effectively manage the resulting greater levels of residual risk.\\nTable of Contents\\nSimilarly, we have provided residual value guarantees to vehicle customers and partners for certain financing programs, under which such counterparties may sell their vehicles through various remarketing channels. However, actual resale values are subject to fluctuations over the term of the financing arrangements, such as from one or more of the factors discussed above. If the actual resale values of any vehicles resold by our vehicle\\ncustomers and partners are lower than the residual values we have agreed to with them, the residual value guarantees may be triggered and, as a result, our financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\\nFinally, our vehicle and solar energy system financing programs and our energy storage sales programs also expose us to customer credit risk. In the event of a widespread economic downturn or other catastrophic event, our customers may be unable or unwilling to satisfy their payment obligations to us on a timely basis or at all. If a significant number of our customers default, we may incur substantial credit losses and/or impairment\\ncharges with respect to the underlying assets.\\nWe must manage ongoing obligations under our agreement with the Research Foundation for the State University of New York relating to our Gigafactory New York.\\nWe are party to an operating lease and a research and development agreement through the State University of New York (the ‚ÄúSUNY Foundation‚Äù). These agreements provide for the construction and use of our Gigafactory New York, which we have primarily used for the development and production of our Solar Roof and other solar products and components, energy storage components and Supercharger components, and for other\\nlessor-approved functions. Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during a period that was initially 10 years beginning April 30, 2018. As of\\nDecember 31, 2024, we have met and expect to meet the requirements under this arrangement, as may be modified and discussed from time to time, based on our current and anticipated level of operations. While we expect to have and grow significant operations at Gigafactory New York and the surrounding Buffalo area, any failure by us in any year over the course of the term of the agreement to meet all applicable future obligations may\\nresult in our incurring financial liabilities in the form of ‚Äúprogram payments‚Äù which would not be expected to have a material adverse effect to our financial operations, the termination of our lease at Gigafactory New York, and/or the need to adjust certain of our operations. Any of the foregoing events may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\\nIf we are unable to attract, hire and retain key employees and qualified personnel, our ability to compete may be harmed.\\nThe loss of the services of any of our key employees or any significant portion of our workforce could disrupt our operations or delay the development, introduction and ramp of our products and services. In particular, we are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer. None of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be\\nable to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business. Our future success also depends upon our ability to attract, hire and retain a large number of engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and delivery, service, installation, technology and support personnel, especially to support our planned high-volume product sales, market and geographical expansion and technological innovations. If we are not\\nsuccessful in managing these risks, our business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\\nEmployees may leave Tesla or choose other employers over Tesla due to various factors, such as a very competitive labor market for talented individuals with automotive or technology experience, or any negative publicity related to us. In regions where we have or will have operations, particularly significant engineering and manufacturing centers, there is strong competition for individuals with skillsets needed for our business,\\nincluding specialized knowledge of electric vehicles, engineering and electrical and building construction expertise. We also compete with both mature and prosperous companies that have far greater financial resources than we do and start-ups and emerging companies that promise short-term growth opportunities.\\nFinally, our compensation philosophy for all of our personnel reflects our startup origins, with an emphasis on equity-based awards and benefits in order to closely align their incentives with the long-term interests of our stockholders. We periodically seek and obtain approval from our stockholders for future increases to the number of awards available under our equity incentive and employee stock purchase plans. If we are unable to\\nobtain the requisite stockholder approvals for such future increases, we may have to expend additional cash to compensate our employees and our ability to retain and hire qualified personnel may be harmed.\\nTable of Contents\\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer.\\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer. Although Mr. Musk spends significant time with Tesla and is highly active in our management, he does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla. For example: Mr. Musk also currently holds management positions at Space Exploration Technologies Corp., X Corp., X.AI Corp., Neuralink Corp. and The Boring Company,\\nand is involved in other ventures and with the Department of Government Efficiency.\\nOur information technology systems or data, or those of our service providers or customers or users could be subject to cyber-attacks or other security incidents, which could result in data breaches, intellectual property theft, claims, litigation, regulatory investigations, significant liability, reputational damage and other adverse consequences.\\nWe continue to expand our information technology systems as our operations grow, such as product data management, procurement, inventory management, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer management, financial, tax and regulatory compliance systems. This includes the implementation of new internally developed systems and the deployment of such systems in the U.S. and abroad. While, we\\nmaintain information technology measures designed to protect us against intellectual property theft, data breaches, sabotage and other external or internal cyber-attacks or misappropriation, our systems and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to malware, ransomware, viruses, denial-of-service attacks, phishing attacks, social engineering, computer hacking, unauthorized access, exploitation of bugs, defects and\\nvulnerabilities, breakdowns, damage, interruptions, system malfunctions, power outages, terrorism, acts of vandalism, security breaches, security incidents, inadvertent or intentional actions by employees or other third parties, and other cyber-attacks.\\nTo the extent any security incident results in unauthorized access or damage to or acquisition, use, corruption, loss, destruction, alteration or dissemination of our data, including intellectual property and personal information, or our products or vehicles, or for it to be believed or reported that any of these occurred, it could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us to comply with applicable data breach notification laws,\\nsubject us to time consuming, distracting and expensive litigation, regulatory investigation and oversight, mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations and contractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and security of personal information. This could result in increased costs to us and result in significant legal and financial\\nexposure and/or reputational harm.\\nWe also rely on service providers, and similar incidents relating to their information technology systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. There have been and may continue to be significant supply chain attacks. Our service providers, including our workforce management software provider, have been subject to ransomware and other security incidents, and we cannot guarantee that our or our service providers‚Äô\\nsystems have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects, bugs, or vulnerabilities that could result in a security incident, or other disruption to, our or our service providers‚Äô systems. Our ability to monitor our service providers‚Äô security measures is limited, and, in any event, malicious third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures.\\nFurther, the implementation, maintenance, segregation and improvement of these systems require significant management time, support and cost, and there are inherent risks associated with developing, improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems and updating current systems, including disruptions to the related areas of business operation. These risks may affect our ability to manage our data and\\ninventory, procure parts or supplies or manufacture, sell, deliver and service products, adequately protect our intellectual property or achieve and maintain compliance with, or realize available benefits under, tax laws and other applicable regulations.\\nMoreover, if we do not successfully implement, maintain or expand these systems as planned, our operations may be disrupted, our ability to accurately and/or timely report our financial results could be impaired and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting, which may impact our ability to certify our financial results. Moreover, our proprietary information, including intellectual property and personal\\ninformation, could be compromised or misappropriated and our reputation may be adversely affected. If these systems or their functionality do not operate as we expect them to, we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions.\\nTable of Contents\\nAny unauthorized control or manipulation of our products‚Äô systems could result in loss of confidence in us and our products.\\nOur products contain complex information technology systems. For example, our vehicles and energy storage products are designed with built-in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update their functionality. While we have implemented security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks, our products and their systems, malicious entities\\nhave reportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to modify, alter and use such networks, products and systems to gain control of, or to change, our products‚Äô functionality, user interface and performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by our products. We encourage reporting of potential vulnerabilities in the security of our products through our security vulnerability reporting\\npolicy, and we aim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerability. However, there can be no assurance that any vulnerabilities will not be exploited before they can be identified, or that our remediation efforts are or will be successful.\\nAny unauthorized access to or control of our products or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or government investigations. In addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our products, their systems or data, as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our products, their systems or data are capable of being hacked, may harm our brand, prospects and operating results.\\nWe have been the subject of such reports in the past.\\nOur business may be adversely affected by any disruptions caused by union activities.\\nIt is not uncommon for employees of certain trades at companies such as ours to belong to a union, which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages. Moreover, regulations in some jurisdictions outside of the U.S. mandate employee participation in industrial collective bargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights with respect to the relevant companies‚Äô operations. Although we\\nwork diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our employees, they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union, or we may be required to become a union signatory. From time to time, labor unions have engaged in campaigns to organize certain of our operations, as part of which such unions have filed unfair labor practice charges against us with the National Labor Relations Board (the ‚ÄúNLRB‚Äù), and\\nthey may do so in the future. Any unfavorable ultimate outcome for Tesla may have a negative impact on the perception of Tesla‚Äôs treatment of our employees. Furthermore, we are directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces, such as suppliers and trucking and freight companies. Any work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and may harm our\\nbusiness and operating results.\\nWe may choose to or be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other similar actions.\\nAs a manufacturing company, we must manage the risk of product recalls with respect to our products. Recalls for our vehicles have resulted from various hardware and software-related safety or non-compliance determinations. In addition to recalls initiated by us for various causes, testing of or investigations into our products by government regulators or industry groups may compel us to initiate product recalls or may result in\\nnegative public perceptions about the safety of our products, even if we disagree with the defect determination or have data that contradicts it. In the future, we may voluntarily or involuntarily initiate recalls or field actions if any of our products are determined by us or a regulator to contain a safety defect or be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations, such as U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, or provide certain\\nfunctionalities. Such recalls or field actions, whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by systems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers, could result in significant expense, supply chain complications and service burdens, and may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\\nOur current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims.\\nWe provide a manufacturer‚Äôs warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell directly to customers. We also provide certain warranties with respect to the energy generation and storage systems we sell, including on their installation and maintenance. For components not manufactured by us, we generally pass through to our customers the applicable manufacturers‚Äô warranties, but may retain some warranty responsibilities for some\\nor all of the life of such components. As part of our energy generation and storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that guarantee that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or other energy performance requirements specified in the contract. Under these performance guarantees, we generally bear the risk of electricity production or other performance shortfalls,\\nincluding in some cases shortfalls caused by failures in components from third party manufacturers. These risks are exacerbated in the event such manufacturers cease operations or fail to honor their warranties.\\nTable of Contents\\nIf our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products, our financial condition and operating results may be harmed. Warranty reserves include our management‚Äôs best estimates of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty, which are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. Such estimates are inherently uncertain and\\nchanges to our historical or projected experience, especially with respect to products that we have introduced relatively recently and/or that we expect to produce at significantly greater volumes than our past products, may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future.\\nOur insurance coverage strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks.\\nWe may be subject, in the ordinary course of business, to losses resulting from products liability, accidents, acts of God and other claims against us, for which we may have no insurance coverage. As a general matter, we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as many other companies do, and in some cases, we do not maintain any at all. Additionally, the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles or self-insured\\nretentions, policy limitations and exclusions, and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims against us. A loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts, which may harm our financial condition and operating results.\\nOur debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business.\\nThe terms of certain of our debt facilities contain, and any of our other future debt agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business, including restrictions on our and/or our subsidiaries‚Äô ability to, among other things, incur additional debt or create liens. In addition, under certain circumstances we are required to maintain a certain amount of liquidity. As a result of these covenants, our\\nability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and engage in beneficial transactions, including to obtain additional financing as needed, may be restricted. Furthermore, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements, which could permit the holders to accelerate our obligation to repay the debt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to\\nrepay it.\\nAdditional funds may not be available to us when we need or want them.\\nOur business and our future plans for expansion are capital-intensive, and the specific timing of cash inflows and outflows may fluctuate substantially from period to period. We may need or want to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-related or debt securities or through obtaining credit from financial institutions to fund, together with our principal sources of liquidity, the costs of developing and manufacturing\\nour current or future products, to pay any significant unplanned or accelerated expenses or for new significant strategic investments, or to refinance our significant consolidated indebtedness, even if not required to do so by the terms of such indebtedness. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our financial condition,\\nresults of operations, business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\\nWe may be negatively impacted by any early obsolescence of our manufacturing equipment.\\nWe depreciate the cost of our manufacturing equipment over their expected useful lives. However, product cycles or manufacturing technology may change periodically, and we may decide to update our products or manufacturing processes more quickly than expected. Moreover, improvements in engineering and manufacturing expertise and efficiency may result in our ability to manufacture our products using less of our currently\\ninstalled equipment. Alternatively, as we ramp and mature the production of our products to higher levels, we may discontinue the use of already installed equipment in favor of different or additional equipment. The useful life of any equipment that would be retired early as a result would be shortened, causing the depreciation on such equipment to be accelerated, and our results of operations may be harmed.\\nThere is no guarantee that we will have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness or that we will not incur additional indebtedness.\\nAs of December 31, 2024, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $7.91 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness (see Note 10, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Our consolidated indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry conditions. We and our subsidiaries may, subject to the limitations in the terms of\\nour existing and future indebtedness, incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt.\\nTable of Contents\\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due, or to refinance our indebtedness as we may need or desire, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness\\nand any future indebtedness we may incur, and to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the\\ncapital markets and our financial condition at such time. In addition, our ability to make payments may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. We may not be able to engage in these activities on desirable terms or at all, which may result in a default on our existing or future indebtedness and harm our financial condition and operating results.\\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies and have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue, operating expenses and localized subsidiary debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To the extent we have significant revenues denominated in such foreign currencies, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in U.S. dollars, as we have historically\\nexperienced, and are currently experiencing. We have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency (primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances). In addition, a portion of our costs and expenses have been, and\\nwe anticipate will continue to be, denominated in foreign currencies. If we do not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if the value of the U.S. dollar depreciates significantly against these currencies, our costs as measured in U.S. dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer. As a result, our operating results may be harmed.\\nWe may not be able to adequately protect or defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims, which may be time-consuming and expensive, or affect the freedom to operate our business.\\nOur competitors or other third parties may hold or obtain patents, copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary rights that could prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, develop, sell or market our products and services, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business. From time to time, the holders of such intellectual property rights may assert their rights and urge us to take licenses and/or may bring suits\\nalleging infringement or misappropriation of such rights, which could result in substantial costs, negative publicity and management attention, regardless of merit.\\nIn addition, the effective protection for our brands, technologies, and proprietary information may be limited or unavailable in certain countries, making it difficult to protect our intellectual property from misappropriation or infringement. Although we make reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, we cannot guarantee that these actions will deter or prevent misappropriation of our intellectual\\nproperty. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and confidential information could affect our competitive position.\\nWhile we endeavor to obtain and protect the intellectual property rights that we expect will allow us to retain or advance our strategic initiatives in these circumstances, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately identify and protect the portions of intellectual property that are strategic to our business, or mitigate the risk of potential suits or other legal demands by third parties. Accordingly, we may consider the entering\\ninto licensing agreements with respect to such rights, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur, and such licenses and associated litigation could significantly increase our operating expenses. Further, if we are determined to have or believe there is a high likelihood that we have infringed upon a third party‚Äôs intellectual property rights, we may be required to cease\\nmaking, selling or incorporating certain components or intellectual property into the goods and services we offer, to pay substantial damages and/or license royalties, to redesign our products and services and/or to establish and maintain alternative branding for our products and services. In the event that we are required to take one or more such actions, our brand, business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\\nIncreased scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to the Company‚Äôs ESG practices may result in additional costs or risks.\\nCompanies across many industries are facing increasing scrutiny related to their environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices. Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the non-financial impacts of their investments. While our mission is to accelerate the\\nworld‚Äôs transition to sustainable\\nTable of Contents\\nenergy, if our ESG practices do not meet investor or other industry stakeholder expectations, which continue to evolve, we may incur additional costs and our brand, ability to attract and retain qualified employees and business may be harmed. Compliance with any current or future legal requirements on these topics may result in additional costs or risks to us, including harm to our reputation, reduction in customer demand, and increased legal\\nand operational risks.\\nOur operations could be adversely affected by events outside of our control, such as natural disasters, wars or health epidemics.\\nWe may be impacted by natural disasters, wars, health epidemics, weather conditions, the long-term effects of climate change, power outages or other events outside of our control. For example, our Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Nevada are located in seismically active regions in Northern California and Nevada, and our Gigafactory Shanghai is located in a flood-prone area. Moreover, the area in which our Gigafactory Texas is\\nlocated experienced severe winter storms in the first quarter of 2021 that had a widespread impact on utilities and transportation. If major disasters such as earthquakes, floods or other climate-related events occur, or our information system or communication breaks down or operates improperly, our headquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged, or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products.\\nAlso, the broader consequences in the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which may include further embargoes, regional instability and geopolitical shifts; airspace bans relating to certain routes, or strategic decisions to alter certain routes; and potential retaliatory action by the Russian government against companies, and the extent of the conflict on our business and operating results cannot be predicted. We may incur expenses or\\ndelays relating to such events outside of our control, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\\nRisks Related to Government Laws and Regulations\\nDemand for our products and services may be impacted by the status of government and economic incentives supporting the development and adoption of such products.\\nGovernment and economic incentives that support the development and adoption of electric vehicles in the U.S. and abroad, including certain tax exemptions, tax credits and rebates, may be reduced, eliminated, amended or exhausted from time to time. For example, previously available incentives favoring electric vehicles in certain areas have expired or were cancelled or temporarily unavailable, and in some cases were not eventually\\nreplaced or reinstituted, which may have negatively impacted sales. In addition, certain government and economic incentives may also be implemented or amended to provide benefits to manufacturers who assemble domestically, have local suppliers or have other characteristics that may not apply to Tesla. Such developments could negatively impact demand for our vehicles, and we and our customers may have to adjust to them, including\\nthrough pricing modifications.\\nIn addition, certain governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives that are currently available with respect to our solar and energy storage product businesses allow us to lower our costs and encourage customers to buy our products and investors to invest in our solar financing funds. However, these incentives may expire when the allocated funding is exhausted, reduced or terminated as renewable energy adoption rates\\nincrease, sometimes without warning. Likewise, in jurisdictions where net metering is currently available, our customers receive bill credits from utilities for energy that their solar energy systems generate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use. The benefit available under net metering has been or has been proposed to be reduced, altered or eliminated in several jurisdictions, and has also been contested and may continue\\nto be contested before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Any reductions or terminations of such incentives may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results by making our products less competitive for customers, increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our ability to attract investment partners and to form new financing funds for our solar and energy storage assets.\\nFinally, we and our fund investors claim these U.S. federal tax credits and certain state incentives in amounts based on independently appraised fair market values of our solar and energy storage systems. Some governmental authorities have audited such values and in certain cases have determined that these values should be lower, and they may do so again in the future. Such determinations may result in adverse tax consequences\\nand/or our obligation to make indemnification or other payments to our funds or fund investors.\\nWe are subject to evolving laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs, legal prohibitions or unfavorable changes upon our operations or products.\\nOur business operations are and will continue to be subject to complex environmental, occupational, health and safety laws and regulations at numerous jurisdictional levels in the U.S., China, Germany and other locations abroad, including laws relating to the use, handling, storage, recycling, disposal and/or human exposure to hazardous materials,\\nTable of Contents\\nproduct material inputs and post-consumer products and with respect to constructing, expanding and maintaining our facilities. New, or changes in, environmental and climate change laws, regulations or rules could also lead to increased costs of compliance, including remediations of any discovered issues, and changes to our operations, which may be significant, and any failures to comply could result in significant expenses, delays or fines.\\nIn addition, as we have increased our operations, we are and may continue to be subject to increased scrutiny, including litigation and government investigations, that we will need to defend against. If we are unable to successfully defend ourselves in such litigation or government investigations, it may harm our brand, ability to attract and retain qualified employees, business and financial condition. We are also subject to laws and regulations\\napplicable to the supply, manufacture, import, sale, service and performance of our products both domestically and abroad. For example, in countries outside of the U.S., we are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety, fuel economy and emissions that are often materially different from equivalent requirements in the U.S., thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance in all\\ncountries. This process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign regulatory agencies prior to market entry, as well as compliance with foreign reporting and recall management systems requirements.\\nIn particular, we offer in our vehicles in certain markets Autopilot and FSD (Supervised) features that today assist drivers with certain tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel, but which currently require drivers to remain fully engaged in the driving operation. We are continuing to develop our Autopilot and FSD (Supervised) technology. There are a variety of international, federal and state regulations that may apply to,\\nand may adversely affect, the design and performance, sale, marketing, registration and operation of Autopilot and FSD (Supervised), and future capability, including autonomous vehicles that may not be operated by a human driver. This includes many existing vehicle standards that were not originally intended to apply to vehicles that may not be operated by a human driver. Such regulations, including their enforcement or the enforcement\\npolicy associated with the regulations, continue to rapidly change, which increases the likelihood of a patchwork of complex or conflicting regulations, or may delay, restrict or prohibit the availability of certain functionalities and vehicle designs, which could adversely affect our business.\\nFinally, as a manufacturer, installer and service provider with respect to solar generation and energy storage systems, a supplier of electricity generated and stored by certain of the solar energy and energy storage systems we install for customers, and a provider of grid services through virtual power plant models, we are impacted by federal, state and local regulations and policies concerning the import or export of components,\\nelectricity pricing, the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the electrical grid and the sale of electricity generated by third party-owned systems. If regulations and policies are introduced that adversely impact the import or export of components, or the interconnection, maintenance or use of our solar and energy storage systems, they could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar and energy storage\\nproducts and services, threaten the economics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy storage system sales and services in the relevant jurisdictions, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\\nAny failure by us to comply with a variety of U.S. and international privacy and consumer protection laws may harm us.\\nAny failure by us or our vendors or other business partners to comply with our public privacy notice or with federal, state or international privacy, data protection, artificial intelligence or security laws or regulations relating to the processing, collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information could result in regulatory or litigation-related actions against us, legal liability, fines, damages, ongoing audit\\nrequirements and other significant costs. Substantial expenses and operational changes may be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws, and even an unsuccessful challenge by customers or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense by us. In addition, certain privacy laws are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty as to their\\ninterpretation, application and impact, and may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation applies to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the European\\nUnion requiring certain data protection measures when handling, with a significant risk of fines for noncompliance. Similarly, our North American operations are subject to complex and changing federal and US state-specific data privacy laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act which imposes certain legal obligations on our use and processing of personal information related to California residents. Finally, additional\\nprivacy and cybersecurity laws have come into effect in China, and other jurisdictions where Tesla has a market presence.\\nThese laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs and make enhancements to relevant data practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\\nTable of Contents\\nIn addition to the risks related to general privacy regulation, we may also be subject to specific vehicle manufacturer obligations relating to cybersecurity, data privacy and data localization requirements which place additional risks to our international operations. Risks and penalties could include ongoing audit requirements, data protection authority investigations, legal proceedings by international governmental entities or others\\nresulting in mandated disclosure of sensitive data or other commercially unfavorable terms. Notwithstanding our efforts to protect the security and integrity of our customers‚Äô personal information, we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements if, for example, third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to\\nthe personal information we process and handle. A major breach of our network security and systems may occur despite defensive measures, and may result in fines, penalties and damages and harm our brand, prospects and operating results.\\nWe could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences arising out of certain governmental investigations and proceedings.\\nWe are cooperating with certain government investigations as discussed in Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To our knowledge, no government agency in any such ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. However, we cannot predict the outcome or impact of any such ongoing matters, and there exists\\nthe possibility that we could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the SEC, the U.S. Department of Justice or any other government agency were to pursue legal action in the future. Moreover, we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information and subpoenas, and if instituted, in defending against any governmental proceedings.\\nWe may face regulatory challenges to or limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly.\\nWhile we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sales strategies, including sales through our website, we may not be able to sell our vehicles through our own stores in certain states in the U.S. with laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on this direct-to-consumer sales model. It has also been asserted that the laws in some states limit our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators, and such\\nassertions persist. In certain locations, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles have been, and may be, challenged by dealer associations and others as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws. We have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such results have reinforced our continuing belief that state franchise laws were not intended to apply to a manufacturer that does not have\\nfranchise dealers anywhere in the world. In some states, there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that, if enacted, would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model. A few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate, but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate. The\\napplication of state laws applicable to our operations continues to be difficult to predict.\\nInternationally, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time. Continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with our ability to sell vehicles directly to consumers\\nmay harm our financial condition and operating results.\\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile.\\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our common stock has experienced over the last 52 weeks an intra-day trading high of $488.54 per share and a low of $138.80 per share. The stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme\\nprice and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In particular, a large proportion of our common stock has been historically and may in the future be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock, further influencing volatility in its market price. Public perception of our company or management and other factors\\noutside of our control may additionally impact the stock price of companies like us that garner a disproportionate degree of public attention, regardless of actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market or the market price of our shares, securities\\nTable of Contents\\nclass action litigation has been filed against us. While we defend such actions vigorously, any judgment against us or any future stockholder litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management‚Äôs attention and resources.\\nOur financial results may vary significantly from period to period due to fluctuations in our operating costs and other factors.\\nWe expect our period-to-period financial results to vary based on our operating costs, which we anticipate will fluctuate as the pace at which we continue to design, develop and manufacture new products and increase production capacity by expanding our current manufacturing facilities and adding future facilities, may not be consistent or linear between periods. Additionally, our revenues from period to period may fluctuate as we\\nintroduce existing products to new markets for the first time and as we develop and introduce new products. As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results, especially in the short term, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance. Moreover, our financial results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts,\\nratings agencies or investors, who may be focused only on short-term quarterly financial results. If any of this occurs, the trading price of our stock could fall substantially, either suddenly or over time.\\nWe may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business, which could cause our stock price to decline.\\nWe provide from time to time guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance. Correctly identifying key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process, and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate and has in the past been inaccurate in certain respects, such as the timing of new product manufacturing ramps. Our guidance is based on certain assumptions such\\nas those relating to anticipated production and sales volumes (which generally are not linear throughout a given period), average sales prices, supplier and commodity costs and planned cost reductions. If our guidance varies from actual results, such as due to our assumptions not being met or the impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of various risks and uncertainties, the market value of our common stock could\\ndecline significantly.\\nIf Elon Musk were forced to sell shares of our common stock, either that he has pledged to secure certain personal loan obligations, or in satisfaction of other obligations, such sales could cause our stock price to decline.\\nCertain banking institutions have made extensions of credit to Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, a portion of which was used to purchase shares of common stock in certain of our public offerings and private placements at the same prices offered to third-party participants in such offerings and placements. We are not a party to these loans, which are partially secured by pledges of a portion of the Tesla common stock currently\\nowned by Mr. Musk. If the price of our common stock were to decline substantially, Mr. Musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of Tesla common stock to satisfy his loan obligations if he could not do so through other means. Any such sales could cause the price of our common stock to decline further. Further, Mr. Musk from time to time may commit to investing in significant business or other ventures,\\nand as a result, be required to sell shares of our common stock in satisfaction of such commitments.\\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our governing documents, applicable laws and certain of our debt facilities could impair a takeover attempt.\\nOur certificate of formation and bylaws afford certain rights and powers to our board of directors that may facilitate the delay or prevention of an acquisition that it deems undesirable. We are also subject to Section 21.606 of the Texas Business Organizations Code and other provisions of Texas law that limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect certain business combinations. In addition, a change in control may cause\\nthe acceleration of certain of our debt facilities. Any of the foregoing provisions and terms that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\\nNone.\\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\\nWe recognize the importance of assessing, identifying, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats, as such term is defined in Item 106(a) of Regulation S-K. These risks include, among other things: operational risks, intellectual property theft, fraud, extortion, harm to employees or customers and violation of data privacy or security laws.\\nIdentifying and assessing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes. Cybersecurity risks related to our business, technical operations, privacy and compliance issues are identified and addressed through a multi-faceted approach including third party assessments, internal IT Audit, IT security, governance, risk and compliance reviews. To defend, detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents,\\nwe, among other things: conduct proactive privacy and cybersecurity reviews of systems and applications, audit applicable data policies, perform penetration testing using external third-party tools and techniques to test security controls, operate a bug bounty program to encourage proactive vulnerability reporting, conduct employee training, monitor emerging laws and regulations related to data protection and information security (including\\nour consumer products) and implement appropriate changes.\\nWe have implemented incident response and breach management processes which have four overarching and interconnected stages: 1) preparation for a cybersecurity incident, 2) detection and analysis of a security incident, 3) containment, eradication and recovery, and 4) post-incident analysis. Such incident responses are overseen by leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and Legal teams regarding\\nmatters of cybersecurity.\\nSecurity events and data incidents are evaluated, ranked by severity and prioritized for response and remediation. Incidents are evaluated to determine materiality as well as operational and business impact, and reviewed for privacy impact.\\nWe also conduct tabletop exercises to simulate responses to cybersecurity incidents. Our team of cybersecurity professionals then collaborate with technical and business stakeholders across our business units to further analyze the risk to the company, and form detection, mitigation and remediation strategies.\\nAs part of the above processes, we regularly engage external auditors and consultants to assess our internal cybersecurity programs and compliance with applicable practices and standards. As of 2024, our Information Security Management System has been certified to conform to the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2013.\\nOur risk management program also assesses third party risks, and we perform third-party risk management to identify and mitigate risks from third parties such as vendors, suppliers, and other business partners associated with our use of third-party service providers. Cybersecurity risks are evaluated when determining the selection and oversight of applicable third-party service providers and potential fourth-party risks when handling\\nand/or processing our employee, business or customer data. In addition to new vendor onboarding, we perform risk management during third-party cybersecurity compromise incidents to identify and mitigate risks to us from third-party incidents.\\nWe describe whether and how risks from identified cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, under the heading ‚ÄúOur information technology systems or data, or those of our service providers or customers or users could be subject to cyber-attacks\\nor other security incidents, which could result in data breaches, intellectual property theft, claims, litigation, regulatory investigations, significant liability, reputational damage and other adverse consequences‚Äù included as part of our risk factor disclosures at Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nCybersecurity Governance\\nCybersecurity is an important part of our risk management processes and an area of focus for our Board and management. Our Audit Committee is responsible for the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats. Members of the Audit Committee receive updates on a quarterly basis from senior management, including leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and Legal teams regarding matters of\\ncybersecurity. This includes existing and new cybersecurity risks, status on how management is addressing and/or mitigating those risks, cybersecurity and data privacy incidents (if any) and status on key information security initiatives. Our Board members also engage in ad hoc conversations with management on cybersecurity-related news events and discuss any updates to our cybersecurity risk management and strategy programs.\\nOur cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes are overseen by leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and Legal teams. Such individuals have an average of over 15 years of prior work experience in various roles involving information technology, including security, auditing, compliance, systems and programming. These individuals are informed about, and monitor the prevention, mitigation,\\ndetection and remediation of cybersecurity incidents through their management of, and participation in, the cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes described above, including the operation of our incident response plan, and report to the Audit Committee on any appropriate items.\\nITEM 2.

MANAGEMENT‚ÄôS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For further discussion of our products and services, technology and competitive strengths, refer to Item 1- Business. For discussion related to changes in financial condition and the results of operations for fiscal year 2023-related items, refer to\\nPart II, Item 7. Management‚Äôs Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2023, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 29, 2024.\\nOverview and 2024 Highlights\\nOur mission is to accelerate the world‚Äôs transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance, installation, operation, charging, insurance, financial and other services related to our products. Additionally, we are increasingly focused on products and services based on AI, robotics\\nand automation.\\nIn 2024, we produced approximately 1,773,000 consumer vehicles and delivered approximately 1,789,000 consumer vehicles. We are focused on profitable growth, including by leveraging existing factories and production lines to introduce new and more affordable products, further improving and deploying our FSD (Supervised) capabilities, including future autonomous capabilities through our purpose-built Robotaxi product,\\nCybercab, reducing costs, increasing vehicle production, utilized capacity and delivery capabilities, improving and developing our vehicles and battery technologies, vertically integrating and localizing our supply chain, and expanding our global infrastructure, including our service and charging infrastructure.\\nIn 2024, we deployed 31.4 GWh of energy storage products. We are focused on ramping the production and increasing the market penetration of our energy storage products.\\nIn 2024, we recognized total revenues of $97.69 billion, representing an increase of $917 million compared to the prior year. In 2024, our net income attributable to common stockholders was $7.09 billion, representing a decrease of $7.91 billion compared to the prior year, primarily due to the impact of releasing $6.54 billion of our valuation allowance associated with U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of\\n2023.We continue to ramp production and build and optimize our manufacturing capacity, expand our operations while focusing on further cost reductions and operational efficiencies to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products, and invest in research and development to accelerate our AI, software, and fleet-based profits for further revenue growth.\\nWe ended 2024 with $36.56 billion in cash and cash equivalents and investments, representing an increase of $7.47 billion from the end of 2023. Our cash flows provided by operating activities were $14.92 billion in 2024 compared to $13.26 billion in 2023, representing an increase of $1.67 billion. Capital expenditures amounted to $11.34 billion in 2024 compared to $8.90 billion in 2023, representing an increase of $2.44 billion.\\nOverall growth has allowed our business to generally fund itself, and we will continue investing in a number of capital-intensive projects and research and development in upcoming periods.\\n32\\n--- Page 5 ---\\nManagement Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2025 Outlook\\nAutomotive‚ÄîProduction\\nThe following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under development, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\\nRegion Vehicle Model(s) Production Status\\nCalifornia Model S / Model X Active\\n Model 3 / Model Y Active\\nShanghai Model 3 / Model Y Active\\nBerlin Model Y Active\\nTexas Model Y Active\\n Cybertruck Active\\nCybercab In development\\nNevada Tesla Semi Pilot production\\nTBD Roadster In development\\nWe are focused on growing our manufacturing capacity, which includes capacity for manufacturing newer vehicle models such as our Cybertruck, Tesla Semi and future vehicles utilizing aspects of our next generation platform, and ramping the production at our Gigafactories to their installed production capacities as well as increasing production rate and efficiency at our current factories. The next phase of production growth will\\ndepend on the continued ramp at our factories and be initiated by advances in autonomy and the introduction of new products, including those built on our next generation vehicle platform, as well as our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are developing to have high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. Our goals are to improve vehicle\\nperformance, decrease production costs and increase affordability and customer awareness.\\nThese plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by new product and manufacturing technologies we introduce, the number of concurrent international projects, any industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages and any future impact from events outside of our control. For example, during the first quarter of 2024, we experienced a sequential\\ndecline in production volumes partially caused by the early phase of the production ramp of the updated Model 3 at our Fremont factory, and factory shutdowns at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg resulting from shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack. In the first quarter of 2025, as we launch our New Model Y worldwide, we may similarly experience delays or declines in production volumes due to\\nsimultaneous manufacturing ramps in facilities on three continents. Moreover, we have set ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory.\\nAutomotive‚ÄîDemand, Sales, Deliveries and Infrastructure\\nOur cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies, and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles‚Äô affordability and have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles. We will also continue to generate demand by improving our vehicles‚Äô performance and functionality, including through product offerings and features based on artificial intelligence such as Autopilot, FSD (Supervised), and other\\nsoftware, and delivering new vehicles and vehicle options, such as our launch of the updated Model 3 in 2024, and the New Model Y in the first quarter of 2025. In addition, we have been increasing awareness, and expanding our vehicle financing programs, including attractive leasing terms for our customers.\\n33\\n--- Page 6 ---\\nHowever, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to shifting consumer trends, political and regulatory uncertainty, including with respect to trade and the environment, all of which can be compounded by inflationary pressures, rising energy prices, interest rate fluctuations and the liquidity of enterprise customers. For example, as inflationary pressures increased across the markets in which we operate, central banks in\\ndeveloped countries raised interest rates rapidly and substantially, which impacted the affordability of vehicle lease and finance arrangements. Further, sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our operations. Moreover, as additional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we\\nwill have to adjust and continue to execute well to maintain our momentum. Additionally, our suppliers‚Äô liquidity and allocation plans may be affected by current challenges in the North American automotive industry, which could reduce our access to components or result in unfavorable changes to cost. These macroeconomic and industry trends have had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on the pricing of, and order rate for our\\nvehicles, and in turn our operating margin. Changes in government and economic policies, incentives or tariffs may also impact our production, sales, cost structure and the competitive landscape. We will continue to adjust accordingly to such developments, and we believe our ongoing cost reduction, including improved production innovation and efficiency at our newest factories and lower logistics costs, and focus on operating leverage will\\ncontinue to benefit us in relation to our competitors, while our new products will help enable future growth.\\nAs our production increases, we must work constantly to similarly increase vehicle delivery capability so that it does not become a bottleneck on our total deliveries. We are also committed to reducing the percentage of vehicles delivered in the third month of each quarter, which will help to reduce the cost per vehicle. As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will also have to continue to increase and staff our delivery,\\nservicing and charging infrastructure accordingly, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction. In particular, as other automotive manufacturers have announced their adoption of the North American Charging Standard (‚ÄúNACS‚Äù) and agreements with us to utilize our Superchargers, we must correspondingly expand our network in order to ensure adequate\\navailability to meet customer demands. We also remain focused on continued enhancements of the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment\\nThe long-term success of this business is dependent upon incremental volume growth. We continue to increase the production and capabilities of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand, including the introduction of Powerwall 3 in 2024, and the ramps of our Megafactories in Shanghai and Lathrop, California. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the\\ntiming of specific project milestones and logistics. As these product lines grow, we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products. At the same time, changes in government and economic incentives or tariffs may also impact our sales, cost structure and the competitive landscape.\\nCash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends\\nOur capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short-term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time, and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions. We are simultaneously developing and ramping new products, building or ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents, piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies,\\nexpanding our Supercharger network and investing in autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled training and products, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of\\nannounced projects under development, all other continuing infrastructure growth and varying levels of inflation, we currently expect our capital expenditures to exceed $11.00 billion in 2025 and in each of the following two fiscal years.\\nOur business has generally been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also generally facilitating positive cash generation. We have and will continue to utilize such cash flows, among other things, to invest in autonomy, do more vertical integration,\\nexpand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers. At the same time, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and other potential variables such as rising material prices and increases in supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability. Overall, we expect\\nour ability to be self-funding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales.\\n34\\n--- Page 7 ---\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (‚ÄúGAAP‚Äù). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other\\nassumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement\\npresentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected.\\nThe estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, resale value guarantee liabilities, income tax, the collectability of accounts and finance receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems\\nsubject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from\\nthese estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nAutomotive Sales\\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (‚ÄúASC 606‚Äù), including access to our FSD (Supervised) features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and\\nover-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus\\nconsideration for expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. Other limited free\\nSupercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD (Supervised) features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized over time. For our obligations\\nrelated to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available.\\nInventory Valuation\\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances\\ndo not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\\n35\\n--- Page 8 ---\\nWarranties\\nWe provide a manufacturer‚Äôs warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual\\nclaims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or\\nPPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for the contractually\\nobligated amounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, our accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (‚ÄúRSUs‚Äù) granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan (the ‚ÄúESPP‚Äù) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing\\nmodel. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for\\nthe awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.\\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues,\\nResearch and development expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In\\ncompleting our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years, and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary differences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company‚Äôs\\nprojected future results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future taxable income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our valuation allowance assessment is based on our\\nbest estimate of future results considering all available information.\\n36\\n--- Page 9 ---\\nFurthermore, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes or taxes payable based on our estimates of the eventual outcome. These effects are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are\\nsupportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that some of those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We are required to file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are subject to audit by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with\\nrespect to our tax positions. We believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our\\nexpectations, such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.\\nResults of Operations\\nRevenues\\n Year Ended December 31, 2024 vs. 2023 Change 2023 vs. 2022 Change\\n(Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2022 $ % $ %\\nAutomotive sales $ 72,480 $ 78,509 $ 67,210 $ (6,029) (8)% $ 11,299 17 %\\nAutomotive regulatory credits 2,763 1,790 1,776 973 54 % 14 1 %\\nAutomotive leasing 1,827 2,120 2,476 (293) (14)% (356) (14)%\\nTotal automotive revenues 77,070 82,419 71,462 (5,349) (6)% 10,957 15 %\\nServices and other 10,534 8,319 6,091 2,215 27 % 2,228 37 %\\nTotal automotive & services and other segment revenue 87,604 90,738 77,553 (3,134) (3)% 13,185 17 %\\nEnergy generation and storage segment revenue 10,086 6,035 3,909 4,051 67 % 2,126 54 %\\nTotal revenues $ 97,690 $ 96,773 $ 81,462 $ 917 1 % $ 15,311 19 %\\nAutomotive & Services and Other Segment\\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, including access to our FSD (Supervised) features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates. These deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting.\\nAutomotive regulatory credits includes sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Our revenue from automotive regulatory credits is directly related to our new vehicle production, sales and pricing negotiated with our customers. We monetize them proactively as new vehicles are sold based on standing arrangements with buyers of such credits, typically as close as possible to the production and delivery of the\\nvehicle or changes in regulation impacting the credits.\\nAutomotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements. Additionally, automotive leasing revenue includes direct sales-type leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with the sales-type lease upon delivery to the customer.\\nServices and other revenue consists of sales of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services and collision, part sales, paid Supercharging, insurance services revenue and retail merchandise sales.\\n2024 compared to 2023\\nAutomotive sales revenue decreased $6.03 billion, or 8%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to lower average selling price on our vehicles driven by overall price reductions and attractive financing options provided in 2024 as well as mix. Additionally, there was a decrease of approximately 22,000 combined Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries. The decreases were\\npartially offset by an increase of approximately 19,000 deliveries of other models primarily due to our production ramp of Cybertruck.

As our intercompany balances are significant in nature and we do not typically\\nhedge foreign currency risk, we can experience significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses from period to period.\\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\\nYear Ended December 31, 2024 vs. 2023 Change 2023 vs. 2022 Change\\n(Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2022 $ % $ %\\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes $ 1,837 $ (5,001) $ 1,132 $ 6,838 Not meaningful $ (6,133) Not meaningful\\nEffective tax rate 20 % (50)% 8 %\\nOur provision for (benefit from) income taxes changed by $6.84 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. Our effective tax rate changed to an expense of 20% in the year ended December 31, 2024 from a benefit of 50% in the year ended December 31, 2023. These changes are primarily due to the impact of releasing the valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets in the\\nfourth quarter of 2023.\\nWe monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In the fourth quarter of 2023, based on the relevant weight of positive and negative evidence, including the amount of our taxable income in recent years which was objective and verifiable, and consideration of our expected future taxable earnings, we concluded that it is more likely than not that most of our U.S.\\nfederal and certain state deferred tax assets are realizable and released $6.54 billion of our valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2024, we continue to conclude that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets are realizable, except for our California deferred tax assets, U.S. foreign tax credits and certain foreign operating losses.\\nSee Note 13, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\nWe expect to continue to generate net positive operating cash flow. The cash we generate from our core operations enables us to fund ongoing operations and production, our research and development projects for new products and technologies including our proprietary battery cells, additional manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturing facilities, the construction of future factories, and the continued expansion of our retail and\\nservice locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, Supercharger, including to support NACS, energy product installation capabilities and autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled products.\\nIn addition, because a large portion of our future expenditures will be to fund our growth, we expect that if needed we will be able to adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment. For example, if our near-term manufacturing operations decrease in scale or ramp more slowly than expected, including due to global economic or business conditions, we may choose to correspondingly slow the pace of our capital\\nexpenditures. Finally, we continually evaluate our cash needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources to fund the rapid growth of our business, including through drawdowns on existing or new debt facilities or financing funds. Conversely, we may also from time to time determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily repay certain indebtedness early.\\n41\\n--- Page 14 ---\\nAccordingly, we believe that our current sources of funds will provide us with adequate liquidity during the 12-month period following December 31, 2024, as well as in the long-term.\\nSee the sections below for more details regarding the material requirements for cash in our business and our sources of liquidity to meet such needs.\\nMaterial Cash Requirements\\nFrom time to time in the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with vendors for the purchase of components and raw materials to be used in the manufacture of our products. However, due to contractual terms, variability in the precise growth curves of our development and production ramps, and opportunities to renegotiate pricing, we generally do not have binding and enforceable purchase orders under such contracts\\nbeyond the short-term, and the timing and magnitude of purchase orders beyond such period is difficult to accurately project.\\nAs discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in Part II, Item 7, Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations‚ÄîManagement Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2025 Outlook‚ÄîCash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we currently expect our capital expenditures to support our projects globally to exceed $11.00 billion in\\n2025 and in each of the following two fiscal years.\\nAs of December 31, 2024, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $7.91 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, of which $2.35 billion is current. As of December 31, 2024, our total minimum lease payments was $7.05 billion, of which $1.19 billion is due in the succeeding 12 months. For details regarding our indebtedness and lease obligations, refer to Note 10, Debt, and Note 11, Leases, to the consolidated financial\\nstatements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nSources and Conditions of Liquidity\\nOur sources to fund our material cash requirements are predominantly from our deliveries and servicing of new and used vehicles, sales and installations of our energy storage products, interest income, and proceeds from debt facilities and equity offerings, when applicable.\\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $16.14 billion and $20.42 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, respectively. Balances held in foreign currencies had a U.S. dollar equivalent of $2.90 billion and consisted primarily of euros and Chinese yuan. We had $5.00 billion of unused committed credit amounts as of December 31, 2024. For details regarding our indebtedness, refer to Note 10, Debt, to the consolidated\\nfinancial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nWe continue adapting our strategy to meet our liquidity and risk objectives, such as investing in U.S. government securities and other investments, invest in autonomy, do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers.\\nSummary of Cash Flows\\n Year Ended December 31,\\n(Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2022\\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 14,923 $ 13,256 $ 14,724 \\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (18,787) $ (15,584) $ (11,973)\\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 3,853 $ 2,589 $ (3,527)\\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\\nOur cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling, general and administrative and working capital. Our operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales and related servicing, customer lease and financing payments, customer deposits, cash from sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and\\nstorage products, and interest income on our cash and investments portfolio. These cash inflows are offset by our payments to suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process, operating expenses, operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings.\\n42\\n--- Page 15 ---\\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $1.67 billion to $14.92 billion during the year ended December 31, 2024 from $13.26 billion during the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to favorable changes in net operating assets and liabilities of $2.29 billion, partially offset by a decrease in net income excluding non-cash expenses, gains and losses of $623 million.\\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\\nNet cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures, which were $11.34 billion and $8.90 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, mainly for AI-related capital expenditures, global factory expansion and machinery and equipment as we expand and enhance our product roadmap. We also purchased $7.45 billion and $6.62 billion of\\ninvestments, net of proceeds from maturities and sales, for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\\nNet cash flows from financing activities increased by $1.26 billion to $3.85 billion during the year ended December 31, 2024 from $2.59 billion during the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a $1.81 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, partially offset by a $1.15 billion increase in repayments of debt. See Note 10, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this\\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding our debt obligations. Additionally, there was an increase of $541 million in proceeds from exercises of stock options and other stock issuances compared to the prior year.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n43\\n--- Page 16 ---\\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\\nForeign Currency Risk\\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the Chinese yuan and euro in relation to our current year operations). In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar for our foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates affect\\nour operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars as we do not typically hedge foreign currency risk.\\nWe have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency (primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances).\\nWe considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term. These changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet date to compute the impact these changes would\\nhave had on our net income before income taxes. These changes would have resulted in a gain or loss of $1.15 billion at December 31, 2024 and $1.01 billion at December 31, 2023, assuming no foreign currency hedging.\\n44\\n--- Page 17 ---\\nITEM 8.

We also have audited the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in\\nall material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\\nChange in Accounting Principle\\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for digital assets in 2024.\\nBasis for Opinions\\nThe Company\\'s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management‚Äôs Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company‚Äôs consolidated financial statements and\\non the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the\\naccounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the\\nassessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\\n46\\n--- Page 19 ---\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nA company‚Äôs internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company‚Äôs internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide\\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company‚Äôs assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nCritical Audit Matters\\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters\\ndoes not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\\nAutomotive Warranty Reserve\\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, total accrued warranty, which primarily relates to the automotive segment, was $6,716 million as of December 31, 2024. The Company provides a manufacturer‚Äôs warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles. A warranty reserve is accrued for these products sold, which includes management‚Äôs best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranty and recalls\\nif identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims.\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the automotive warranty reserve is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in determining the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management‚Äôs significant assumptions related to the nature,\\nfrequency and costs of future claims for certain Tesla vehicle models; and, (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management‚Äôs estimate of the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models, including controls over management‚Äôs significant assumptions related to the nature, frequency and\\ncosts of future claims as well as the completeness and accuracy of actual claims incurred to date. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of historical vehicle claims processed and testing that such claims were appropriately used by management in the estimation of future claims and (ii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the\\nreasonableness of management‚Äôs estimate by (a) developing an independent estimate of the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models and (b) comparing the independent estimate to management‚Äôs estimate. Developing the independent estimate involved evaluating the appropriateness of certain aspects of management‚Äôs significant assumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims.\\n/s/

---\\nTesla, Inc.\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nNote 1 ‚Äì Overview\\nTesla, Inc. (‚ÄúTesla‚Äù, the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù, ‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúus‚Äù or ‚Äúour‚Äù) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 1, 2003 and converted to a Texas corporation on June 13, 2024. We design, develop, manufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems, and offer services related to our products.\\nNote 2 ‚Äì Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation (‚ÄúASC 810‚Äù), we consolidate any variable interest entity (‚ÄúVIE‚Äù) of which we are the primary beneficiary. We have formed VIEs with financing fund\\ninvestors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity; however, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not\\ninvolve controlling voting interests. ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE‚Äôs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not consolidate a VIE in\\nwhich we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the VIEs (see Note 15, Variable Interest Entity Arrangements). We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures in the accompanying notes. The estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, resale value guarantee\\nliabilities, income taxes, the collectability of accounts and finance receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and\\nassumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\\nReclassifications\\nCertain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes.\\n53\\n--- Page 26 ---\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenue by source\\nThe following table disaggregates our revenue by major source (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2024 2023 2022\\nAutomotive sales $ 72,480 $ 78,509 $ 67,210 \\nAutomotive regulatory credits 2,763 1,790 1,776 \\nEnergy generation and storage sales 9,564 5,515 3,376 \\nServices and other 10,534 8,319 6,091 \\nTotal revenues from sales and services 95,341 94,133 78,453 \\nAutomotive leasing 1,827 2,120 2,476 \\nEnergy generation and storage leasing 522 520 533 \\nTotal revenues $ 97,690 $ 96,773 $ 81,462 \\nAutomotive Segment\\nAutomotive Sales\\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, including access to our FSD(Supervised) features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery\\nto the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees\\nor similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever\\nis earlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD (Supervised) features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to\\ndevelop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available.\\nAny fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer‚Äôs lender when we arrange the financing are recognized upfront as an offset against automotive sales revenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions for the sale of vehicles. As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and\\nhandling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\\nWe offer resale value guarantees to our commercial banking partners in connection with certain vehicle leasing programs. Under these programs, we originate the lease with our end customer and immediately transfer the lease and the underlying vehicle to our commercial banking partner, with the transaction being accounted for as a sale under ASC 606.\\n54\\n--- Page 27 ---\\nWe receive upfront payment for the vehicle, do not bear casualty and credit risks during the lease term, and we provide a guarantee capped to a limit if they are unable to sell the vehicle at or above the vehicle‚Äôs contractual or determined residual value at the end of the lease term. We estimate a guarantee liability in accordance with ASC 460, Guarantees and record it within other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. On a\\nquarterly basis, we assess the estimated market value of vehicles sold under these programs to determine whether there have been changes to the amount of expected resale value guarantee liabilities. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. The total recorded guarantee liabilities on vehicles sold under these programs were\\nimmaterial as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Our maximum exposure on the guarantees we provide if they are unable to sell the vehicle at or above the vehicle‚Äôs contractual residual value at the end of the lease term was $1.45 billion and $166 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\\nDeferred revenue related to the access to our FSD (Supervised) features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates primarily on automotive sales consisted of the following (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2024 2023\\nDeferred revenue ‚Äî beginning of period $ 3,536 $ 2,913 \\nAdditions 1,343 1,201 \\nNet changes in liability for pre-existing contracts,\\n   including foreign exchange impact (92) 17 \\nRevenue recognized (1,188) (595)\\nDeferred revenue ‚Äî end of period $ 3,599 $ 3,536 \\nDeferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as of the balance sheet date. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $872 million and $469 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of the total deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2024, we expect\\nto recognize $840 million of revenue in the next 12 months. The remaining balance will be recognized at the time of transfer of control of the product or over the performance period as discussed above in Automotive Sales.\\nWe have financing receivables on our consolidated balance sheets related to loans we provide for financing our automotive deliveries. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had current net financing receivables of $247 million and $242 million, respectively, in Accounts receivable, net, and $821 million and $1.04 billion, respectively, in Other non-current assets for the long-term portion.\\nAutomotive Regulatory Credits\\nWe earn tradable credits in the operation of our automotive business under various regulations related to ZEVs, greenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements.\\nPayments for automotive regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer, or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credits, which have negligible incremental costs associated with them, at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party. Deferred revenue related to sales of automotive\\nregulatory credits was immaterial as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we had also recognized $288 million in revenue due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional consideration for credits sold previously. We have elected the\\npractical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected contract length of one year or less. As of December 31, 2024, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $4.68 billion. Of this amount, we expect to\\nrecognize $863 million in the next 12 months and the rest over the remaining performance obligation period. Additionally, changes in regulations on automotive regulatory credits may significantly impact our remaining performance obligations and revenue to be recognized under these contracts.\\n55\\n--- Page 28 ---\\nAutomotive Leasing Revenue\\nDirect Vehicle Operating Leasing Program\\nWe have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle operating leasing programs in the U.S., Canada and in certain countries in Europe. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers may opt to return the vehicles to us or purchase the vehicles when contractually permitted. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We record\\nleasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $1.78 billion, $1.86 billion and $1.75 billion of direct vehicle leasing revenue, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had deferred $394 million and $458 million,\\nrespectively, of lease-related upfront payments, which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the individual leases.\\nOur policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\\nDirect Sales-Type Leasing Program\\nWe have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements accounted for as sales-type leases under ASC 842, Leases (‚ÄúASC 842‚Äù), in certain countries in Asia and Europe. Our arrangements under these programs can have terms for up to 72 months. We recognize all revenue and costs associated with the sales-type lease as automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue, respectively,\\nupon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Interest income based on the implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a monthly basis. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $12 million, $215 million and $683 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing revenue and $7 million, $164 million and $427 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost\\nof revenue.\\nServices and Other Revenue\\nServices and other revenue consists of sales of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services and collision, part sales, paid Supercharging, insurance services revenue and retail merchandise sales.\\nRevenues related to repair, maintenance and vehicle insurance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service plans are recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a stand-ready obligation to the customer. We sell used vehicles, services, service plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling prices as the basis for\\nrevenue allocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations. Payment for used vehicles, services, vehicle components, and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included\\nwithin Accrued liabilities and other on the consolidated balance sheets. We record in Deferred revenue any non-refundable prepayment amounts that are collected from customers and unearned insurance premiums, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. Deferred revenue excluding unearned insurance premiums was not material as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Sales\\nEnergy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential, small commercial, large commercial and utility grade customers. Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small-scale commercial customers consist of the engineering, design and installation of the system. Residential and small-scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar\\nenergy system upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small-scale commercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is\\nwhen the product has been delivered or, if we are performing installation, when installed and commissioned. Payment for such storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business.\\n56\\n--- Page 29 ---\\nFor certain large commercial and utility grade energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering, design and installation of the system, customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a project. Revenue from such contracts is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage\\nsystem sales.\\nIn instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or by using market data for comparable products. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of\\nenergy storage systems. As our contract costs related to energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred.\\nAs part of certain energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy performance requirements specified in the contract. If an energy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated damages. Other forms of variable consideration related to our large\\ncommercial and utility grade energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market participation activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available. Such estimates are\\nincluded in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.\\nWe record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are primarily related to prepayments from customers, which is recognized as revenue as or when the performance obligations are satisfied. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $1.77 billion and $1.60 billion, respectively, mainly due to contractual payment terms. Revenue recognized from the deferred\\nrevenue balance as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $1.27 billion and $571 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for energy generation and storage sales with an original expected contract length of one year or less and the amount that we have the right to invoice\\nwhen that amount corresponds directly with the value of the performance to date. As of December 31, 2024, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $7.18 billion. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $4.51 billion in the next 12 months and the rest over the remaining performance obligation period.\\nWe have financing receivables on our consolidated balance sheets related to loans we provide for financing our energy products. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had current net financing receivables of $34 million and $31 million, respectively, in Accounts receivable, net, and $658 million and $578 million, respectively, in Other non-current assets for the long-term portion.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Leasing\\nFor revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products, we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems, on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The difference between the payments received and the revenue\\nrecognized is recorded as deferred revenue or deferred asset on the consolidated balance sheet.\\nFor solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs prior to January 1, 2019, we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840, Leases. Revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\\nWe record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, including lease prepayments, in excess of revenue recognized, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $164 million and $181 million, respectively. Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and\\nincentives received from utility companies and various local and state government agencies, which is recognized as revenue over the lease term. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, deferred revenue from rebates and incentives was immaterial.\\n57\\n--- Page 30 ---\\nWe capitalize initial direct costs from the execution of agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs, which include the referral fees and sales commissions, as an element of solar energy systems, net, and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related agreements.\\nCost of Revenues\\nAutomotive Segment\\nAutomotive Sales\\nCost of automotive sales revenue includes direct and indirect materials, labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, FSD (Supervised) ongoing maintenance costs, electricity costs for our free Supercharging programs and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to\\nwarranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of automotive sales revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned, amounting to $625 million and $359 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\\nAutomotive Leasing\\nCost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles, cost of goods sold associated with direct sales-type leases and warranty expense related to leased vehicles.\\nServices and Other\\nCosts of services and other revenue includes cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs, costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services, costs associated with our body shops and part sales, costs of paid Supercharging, costs to provide vehicle insurance and costs of retail merchandise sales.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, freight, warranty expense, and cost of servicing. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand\\ninventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of energy generation and storage revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned, amounting to $756 million and $115 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance\\ncosts associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.\\nResearch and Development Costs\\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are\\nestablished when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\\n58\\n--- Page 31 ---\\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In completing our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we\\nconsider our history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary differences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company‚Äôs projected future results of business operations, including uncertainty in\\nfuture operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future taxable income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all available information.\\nWe record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense.\\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (‚ÄúGILTI‚Äù) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. We elected the deferred method, under which we recorded the corresponding deferred tax\\nassets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\\nComprehensive Income\\nComprehensive income is comprised of net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) consists of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized net gains and losses on investments that have been excluded from the determination of net income.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and RSUs granted to employees and for our ESPP to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires\\ninputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally\\nfour years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.\\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues,\\nResearch and development expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\\n59\\n--- Page 32 ---\\nNoncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\\nNoncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent third-party interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements, or funds, that we have entered into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases. We have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit-sharing arrangements. We have further determined that the methodology for\\ncalculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit-sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value (‚ÄúHLBV‚Äù) method. We, therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method, which is\\npresented on the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV method, the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the third parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming\\nthe net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third parties. The third parties‚Äô interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each\\nreporting period, after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the third parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount. The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these third parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other\\nassets.\\nNet Income per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders\\nBasic net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the weighted-average shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards, warrants and convertible senior notes using the treasury stock\\nmethod or the if-converted method, as applicable, are included when calculating diluted net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders when their effect is dilutive.\\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to net income used in computing basic and diluted net income per share of common stock (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2024 2023 2022\\nNet income attributable to common stockholders $ 7,091 $ 14,997 $ 12,556 \\nLess: Buy-outs of noncontrolling interests (39) (2) (27)\\nNet income used in computing basic net income per share of common stock 7,130 14,999 12,583 \\nLess: Dilutive convertible debt ‚Äî ‚Äî (1)\\nNet income used in computing diluted net income per share of common stock $ 7,130 $ 14,999 $ 12,584 \\n60\\n--- Page 33 ---\\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2024 2023 2022\\nWeighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock, basic 3,197 3,174 3,130\\nAdd:\\nStock-based awards 292 298 310\\nConvertible senior notes 1 2 3\\nWarrants 8 11 32\\nWeighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock, diluted 3,498 3,485 3,475\\nThe following table presents the potentially dilutive shares that were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders, because their effect was anti-dilutive (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2024 2023 2022\\nStock-based awards 15 12 4\\nCash and Cash Equivalents\\nAll highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents.\\nRestricted Cash\\nWe maintain certain cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or use. Our restricted cash is comprised primarily of cash held to service certain payments under various secured debt facilities, cash held as collateral for sales to lease partners with a resale value guarantee and deposits held for our insurance services. We record restricted cash as other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and determine current or non-current\\nclassification based on the expected duration of the restriction.\\nOur total cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows, was as follows (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2024December 31,\\n2023December 31,\\n2022\\nCash and cash equivalents $ 16,139 $ 16,398 $ 16,253 \\nRestricted cash included in prepaid expenses and other current assets 494 543 294 \\nRestricted cash included in other non-current assets 404 248 377 \\nTotal as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows $ 17,037 $ 17,189 $ 16,924 \\nInvestments\\nOur investments are all designated as available-for-sale and reported at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss which is included within stockholders‚Äô equity. Available-for-sale marketable securities with maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are included in short-term investments in our consolidated balance sheets. Interest, dividends, amortization\\nand accretion of purchase premiums and discounts on these investments are included within Interest income in our consolidated statements of operations. Interest income on our short-term investments for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $763 million, $388 million and an immaterial amount, respectively.\\n61\\n--- Page 34 ---\\nThe cost of available-for-sale investments sold is based on the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale investments are recorded in Other income (expense), net.\\nWe regularly review all of our investments for declines in fair value. The review includes but is not limited to (i) the consideration of the cause of the decline, (ii) any currently recorded expected credit losses and (iii) the creditworthiness of the respective security issuers. The amortized cost basis of our investments approximates its fair value.\\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\\nAccounts receivable primarily include amounts related to receivables from financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products to our customers, sales of energy generation and storage products, sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers and government rebates already passed through to customers. We provide an allowance against accounts receivable for the amount we expect to be\\nuncollectible. We write-off accounts receivable against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible.\\nDepending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for certain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from our financing partners, which can take up to approximately two weeks based on the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our accounts receivable balances associated with sales of\\nenergy storage products are dependent on billing milestones and payment terms negotiated for each contract, and our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits are dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a\\nsignificant impact on our accounts receivable balance from period to period. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, government rebates receivable was $315 million and $378 million, respectively, in Accounts receivable, net for the current portion and an immaterial amount and $207 million, respectively, in Other non-current assets for the long-term portion in our consolidated balance sheets.\\nFinancing Receivables\\nWe provide financing options to our customers for our automotive and energy products. Financing receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover expected credit losses on the financing receivables. In determining expected credit losses, we consider our\\nhistorical level of credit losses, current economic trends, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the future cash flows. Interest income on financing receivables is recognized over the loan term as revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.\\nWhen originating consumer receivables, we review the credit application, the proposed contract terms, credit bureau information (e.g., FICO score) and other information. Our evaluation emphasizes the applicant‚Äôs ability to pay and creditworthiness focusing on payment, affordability, and applicant credit history as key considerations. Generally, all customers in this portfolio have strong creditworthiness at loan origination.\\nAfter origination, we review the credit quality of retail financing based on customer payment activity and aging analysis. For all financing receivables, we define ‚Äúpast due‚Äù as any payment, including principal and interest, which is at least 31 days past the contractual due date. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the vast majority of our financing receivables were at current status with an immaterial balance being past due. As of\\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, the majority of our financing receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2023 and 2022.\\nWe have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program, which provided residential customers with the option to finance the purchase of a solar energy system through a 30-year loan and were all originated prior to year 2018. The outstanding balances, net of any allowance for expected credit losses, are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the\\ncurrent portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable, net of allowance for expected credit losses, was $248 million and $266 million, respectively, of which $4 million and $5 million were due in the next 12 months as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the allowance for\\nexpected credit losses was $33 million and $36 million, respectively.\\n62\\n--- Page 35 ---\\nConcentration of Risk\\nCredit Risk\\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, investments, restricted cash, accounts receivable and other finance receivables. Our cash and investments balances are primarily on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions or invested in highly rated, investment-grade securities. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of December 31, 2024 and\\n2023, no entity represented 10% or more of our total receivables balance.\\nSupply Risk\\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\\nInventory Valuation\\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances\\ndo not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\\nOperating Lease Vehicles\\nVehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program are classified as operating lease vehicles at cost less accumulated depreciation. We generally depreciate their cost, less residual value, using the straight-line-method to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the contractual period. The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $7.03 billion and $7.36 billion, respectively. Operating\\nlease vehicles on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation of $1.45 billion and $1.38 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\\nDigital Assets, Net\\nWe account for all digital assets held as crypto assets, a subset of indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350-60, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Crypto Assets. We have ownership of and control over our digital assets and we may use third-party custodial services to secure it. The digital assets are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently remeasured on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. Periods\\nprior to January 1, 2024 include digital assets at cost, net of impairment losses incurred since their acquisition.\\nWe determine and record the fair value of our digital assets in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (‚ÄúASC 820‚Äù), based on quoted prices on the active exchange(s) that we have determined is the principal market for such assets (Level I inputs). We determine the cost basis of our digital assets using the specific identification of each unit received. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are now recorded to Other income\\n(expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations.\\n63\\n--- Page 36 ---\\nFor periods prior to January 1, 2024, impairment losses were recognized within Restructuring and other in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the impairment was identified. Also for periods prior to January 1, 2024, gains were not recorded until realized upon sale(s), at which point they were presented net of any impairment losses for the same digital assets held within Restructuring and other. In\\ndetermining the gain to be recognized upon sale, we calculate the difference between the sales price and carrying value of the digital assets sold immediately prior to sale.\\nSee Note 3, Digital Assets, Net, for further information regarding digital assets.\\nSolar Energy Systems, Net\\nWe are the lessor of solar energy systems, which are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of solar energy systems is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 30 to 35 years. The gross cost of solar energy systems as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $6.79 billion and $6.87 billion, respectively. Solar energy systems on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of\\naccumulated depreciation of $1.86 billion and $1.64 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\\nProperty, plant and equipment, net, including leasehold improvements, are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:\\nMachinery, equipment, vehicles and office furniture 3 to 15 years\\nTooling 4 to 7 years\\nBuilding and building improvements 15 to 30 years\\nComputer equipment and software 3 to 6 years\\nAI infrastructure 5 to 30 years\\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. AI infrastructure includes our owned data centers.\\nUpon the retirement or sale of our property, plant and equipment, the cost and associated accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations. Maintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as incurred while major improvements that increase the functionality, output or expected life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated\\nratably over the identified useful life.\\nLong-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets\\nWe review our property, plant and equipment, solar energy systems, long-term prepayments and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is not recoverable, its\\ncarrying amount would be adjusted down to its fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we have recognized no material impairments of our long-lived assets.\\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from seven to thirty years.\\nGoodwill\\nWe assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired, by comparing its carrying value to the reporting unit‚Äôs fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we did not recognize any impairment of goodwill.\\n64\\n--- Page 37 ---\\nCapitalization of Software Costs\\nWe capitalize costs incurred in the development of internal use software, during the application development stage to Property, plant and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of three to five years.\\nSoftware development costs incurred in development of software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed, incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility and prior to the general availability of the software are capitalized when they are expected to become significant. Such costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the applicable software once it is made generally available to our customers.\\nWe evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis, and we test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we have recognized no impairments of capitalized software costs.\\nForeign Currency\\nWe determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international subsidiaries and their operating divisions based on the primary currency in which they operate. In cases where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, we recognize a cumulative translation adjustment created by the different rates we apply to current period income or loss and the balance sheet. For each subsidiary, we apply the monthly average\\nfunctional exchange rate to its monthly income or loss and the month-end functional currency rate to translate the balance sheet.\\nForeign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in Other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded a net foreign currency transaction gain of\\n$57 million, gain of $122 million and loss of $89 million, respectively.\\nWarranties\\nWe provide a manufacturer‚Äôs warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual\\nclaims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or\\nPPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for the contractually\\nobligated amounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, our accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment. Accrued\\nwarranty activity consisted of the following (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2024 2023 2022\\nAccrued warranty‚Äîbeginning of period $ 5,152 $ 3,505 $ 2,101 \\nWarranty costs incurred (1,453) (1,225) (803)\\nNet changes in liability for pre-existing warranties, including expirations and foreign exchange impact 287 539 522 \\nProvision for warranty 2,730 2,333 1,685 \\nAccrued warranty‚Äîend of period $ 6,716 $ 5,152 $ 3,505 \\n65\\n--- Page 38 ---\\nCustomer Deposits\\nCustomer deposits primarily consist of refundable cash payments from customers at the time they place an order or reservation for a vehicle or an energy product and any additional payments up to the point of delivery or the completion of installation. Customer deposits also include prepayments on contracts that can be cancelled without significant penalties, such as vehicle maintenance plans. Customer deposits are included in\\nAccrued liabilities and other on the consolidated balance sheets until refunded, forfeited or applied towards the customer‚Äôs purchase balance.\\nGovernment Assistance Programs and Incentives\\nGlobally, the operation of our business is impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements. Government incentives are recorded in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with their purpose as a reduction of expense, or an offset to the related capital asset. The benefit is generally recorded when all conditions attached to the incentive have been met or are expected to be met and there is\\nreasonable assurance of their receipt.\\nThe IRA Incentives\\nOn August 16, 2022, the IRA was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The IRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, in addition to a new corporate alternative minimum tax of 15% on adjusted financial statement income of corporations with profits greater than $1 billion. Some of these measures are\\nexpected to materially affect our consolidated financial statements. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the impact from our IRA incentive was primarily a reduction of our costs of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.\\nGigafactory New York‚ÄîNew York State Investment and Lease\\nWe have a lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to designate further buildouts at the facility. We are required to comply with certain covenants, including hiring and cumulative investment targets. Under the terms of the arrangement, the SUNY Foundation paid for a majority of the\\nconstruction costs related to the manufacturing facility and the acquisition and commissioning of certain manufacturing equipment; and we are responsible for any construction or equipment costs in excess of such amount (refer to Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies). This incentive reduces the related lease costs of the facility within the Energy generation and storage cost of revenues and operating expense line items in our consolidated\\nstatements of operations and was not material for any period presented.\\nGigafactory Shanghai‚ÄîLand Use Rights and Economic Benefits\\nWe have an agreement with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights at Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to meet a cumulative capital expenditure target and an annual tax revenue target starting at the end of 2023. In addition, the Shanghai government has granted to our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary certain incentives to be used in connection with eligible capital investments at\\nGigafactory Shanghai (refer to Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies). Incentives that offset costs of our facilities are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the capital investment within the Property, plant and equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets and incentives related to our manufacturing operations are recorded as an offset to cost of revenues in our consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended\\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, the amounts received were immaterial.\\nNevada Tax Incentives\\nIn connection with the construction of Gigafactory Nevada, we entered into agreements in 2014 with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that provide abatements for specified taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits of up to $195 million in consideration of capital investment and hiring targets that were met at Gigafactory Nevada.\\n66\\n--- Page 39 ---\\nGigafactory Texas Tax Incentives\\nIn connection with the construction of Gigafactory Texas, we entered into a 20-year agreement in 2020 with Travis County in Texas pursuant to which we would receive grant funding equal to 70-80% of property taxes paid by us to Travis County and a separate 10-year agreement in 2020 with the Del Valle Independent School District in Texas pursuant to which a portion of the taxable value of our property would be capped at a\\nspecified amount, in each case subject to our meeting certain minimum economic development metrics through our construction and operations at Gigafactory Texas. This incentive is recorded as a reduction of the related expenses within the Cost of automotive revenues and operating expense line items of our consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the grant funding related to property\\ntaxes paid were immaterial.\\nDefined Contribution Plan\\nWe have a 401(k) savings plan in the U.S. that is intended to qualify as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code and a number of savings plans internationally. Under the 401(k) savings plan, participating employees may elect to contribute up to 90% of their eligible compensation, subject to certain limitations. Beginning in January 2022, we began to match 50% of each employee‚Äôs contributions\\nup to a maximum of 6% (capped at $3,000) of the employee‚Äôs eligible compensation, vested upon one year of service. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $107 million, $99 million and $91 million, respectively, of expenses related to employer contributions for the 401(k) savings plan.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (‚ÄúFASB‚Äù) issued Accounting Standards Update (‚ÄúASU‚Äù) No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740). The ASU requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity‚Äôs effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income taxes paid. The ASU is effective on a prospective basis for annual periods beginning after December\\n15, 2024. Early adoption is also permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. This ASU will likely result in the required additional disclosures being included in our consolidated financial statements, once adopted.\\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (Subtopic 220-40). The ASU requires the disaggregated disclosure of specific expense categories, including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, and amortization, within relevant income statement captions. This ASU also requires disclosure of the total amount of selling expenses along with the definition of\\nselling expenses. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Adoption of this ASU can either be applied prospectively to consolidated financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date of this ASU or retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. Early adoption is also\\npermitted. This ASU will likely result in the required additional disclosures being included in our consolidated financial statements, once adopted. We are currently evaluating the provisions of this ASU.\\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280). This ASU updates reportable segment disclosure requirements by requiring disclosures of significant reportable segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (‚ÄúCODM‚Äù) and included within each reported measure of a segment\\'s profit or loss. This ASU also requires disclosure\\nof the title and position of the individual identified as the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of a segment‚Äôs profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We adopted this ASU retrospectively on December 31,\\n2024. Refer to Note 17, Segment Reporting and Information about Geographic Areas for the inclusion of the new required disclosures.\\n67\\n--- Page 40 ---\\nASU 2023-08\\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-08, Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60) (‚Äúnew crypto assets standard‚Äù). The new crypto assets standard requires certain crypto assets to be measured at fair value separately on the balance sheet with changes reported in the statement of operations each reporting period. The new crypto assets standard also enhances the other intangible asset disclosure\\nrequirements by requiring the name, cost basis, fair value, and number of units for each significant crypto asset holding. The new crypto assets standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the new crypto assets standard requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the annual reporting\\nperiod in which an entity adopts the amendments. Early adoption is also permitted, including adoption in an interim period. However, if the new crypto assets standard is early adopted in an interim period, an entity must adopt the new crypto assets standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period. We adopted the new crypto assets standard on a modified retrospective approach effective January 1, 2024. Refer to\\nNote 3, Digital Assets, Net for the inclusion of the new required disclosures. The cumulative effect of the changes made on our January 1, 2024 consolidated balance sheet for the adoption of the new crypto assets standard was as follows (in millions):\\nBalances at\\n December 31, 2023 Adjustments from Adoption of the New Crypto Assets StandardBalances at\\n January 1, 2024\\nAssets\\nDigital assets, net $ 184 $ 303 $ 487 \\nDeferred tax assets 6,733 (67) 6,666 \\nStockholders\\' equity\\nRetained earnings 27,882 236 28,118 \\nNote 3 ‚Äì Digital Assets, Net\\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we purchased and/or received immaterial amounts of digital assets.

As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs should be\\nused in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value. Our assets and liabilities that were\\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions):\\n December 31, 2024 December 31, 2023\\n Fair Value Level I Level II Level III Fair Value Level I Level II Level III\\nCertificates of deposit and time deposits $ 12,767 $ ‚Äî $ 12,767 $ ‚Äî $ 6,996 $ ‚Äî $ 6,996 $ ‚Äî \\nCommercial paper 3,919 ‚Äî 3,919 ‚Äî 470 ‚Äî 470 ‚Äî \\nU.S. government securities 3,620 ‚Äî 3,620 ‚Äî 5,136 ‚Äî 5,136 ‚Äî \\nCorporate debt securities 118 ‚Äî 118 ‚Äî 480 ‚Äî 480 ‚Äî \\nMoney market funds 1,753 1,753 ‚Äî ‚Äî 109 109 ‚Äî ‚Äî \\nDigital assets 1,076 1,076 ‚Äî ‚Äî Not applicable\\nTotal $ 23,253 $ 2,829 $ 20,424 $ ‚Äî $ 13,191 $ 109 $ 13,082 $ ‚Äî \\nAll of our money market funds and digital assets are classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using quoted prices in active markets.

Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only assets of our subsidiaries. The differences between the unpaid principal balances and the net carrying values are due to debt discounts or deferred issuance costs. As of December 31, 2024, we were in material compliance with all financial debt covenants.\\n2024 Notes\\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the 2024 Notes reached maturity and were fully settled. Additionally, in 2024, we fully settled the warrants entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes, resulting in the issuance of 11.4 million shares of our common stock.\\nCredit Agreement\\nIn January 2023, we entered into a 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the ‚ÄúRCF Credit Agreement‚Äù) with a syndicate of banks. The RCF Credit Agreement contains two optional one-year extensions and has a total commitment of up to $5.00 billion, which could be increased up to $7.00 billion under certain circumstances. The underlying borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes. Borrowed funds accrue\\ninterest at a variable rate equal to: (i) for dollar-denominated loans, at our election, (a) Term SOFR (the forward-looking secured overnight financing rate) plus 0.10%, or (b) an alternate base rate; (ii) for loans denominated in pounds sterling, SONIA (the sterling overnight index average reference rate); or (iii) for loans denominated in euros, an adjusted EURIBOR (euro interbank offered rate); in each case, plus an applicable margin. The\\napplicable margin will be based on the rating assigned to our senior, unsecured long-term indebtedness (the ‚ÄúCredit Rating‚Äù) from time to time. The fee for undrawn amounts is variable based on the Credit Rating and is currently 0.125% per annum.\\nAutomotive Asset-backed Notes\\nFrom time to time, we transfer receivables and/or beneficial interests related to certain vehicles (either leased or financed) into special purpose entities (‚ÄúSPEs‚Äù) and issue Automotive Asset-backed Notes, backed by these automotive assets to investors. The SPEs are consolidated in the financial statements. The cash flows generated by these automotive assets are used to service the principal and interest payments on the Automotive\\nAsset-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs‚Äô expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to the owners of the SPEs. We recognize revenue earned from the associated customer lease or financing contracts in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The SPEs‚Äô assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including the Automotive Asset-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other\\nassets.\\nIn 2024, we transferred beneficial interests related to certain leased vehicles and/or financing receivables into SPEs and issued $2.45 billion in aggregate principal amount of Automotive Asset-backed Notes, with terms similar to our other previously issued Automotive Asset-backed Notes. The proceeds from the issuance, net of debt issuance costs, were $2.44 billion.\\nEnergy Asset-backed Notes\\nIn 2024, we transferred certain financing receivables into an SPE and issued $499 million in aggregate principal amount of Energy Asset-backed Notes, backed by these financing receivables. The proceeds from issuance, net of debt issuance costs, were $494 million. The SPE is wholly owned by us and is consolidated in the financial statements. The cash flows generated by these financing receivables are used to service the principal\\nand interest payments on the Energy Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the SPE‚Äôs expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to us. The SPE‚Äôs assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPE, including the Energy Asset-backed Notes holders, have no recourse to our other assets.\\nCash Equity Debt\\nIn connection with the cash equity financing deals closed in 2016, our subsidiaries issued $502 million in aggregate principal amount of debt that bears interest at fixed rates. This debt is secured by, among other things, our interests in certain financing funds and is non-recourse to our other assets.\\n74\\n--- Page 47 ---\\nChina Working Capital Facility\\nIn April 2024, one of our subsidiaries entered into a loan agreement (the ‚ÄúChina Working Capital Facility‚Äù) with lenders in China for an unsecured revolving facility of up to RMB 20.00 billion to be used for certain production expenditures as well as repayment of certain finance facilities. Borrowed funds bear interest at a rate equal to the Loan Prime Rate published by the People‚Äôs Bank of China minus 1.18%. The China Working\\nCapital Facility is non-recourse to our assets.\\nPledged Assets\\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had pledged or restricted $5.16 billion and $4.64 billion of our assets (consisting principally of operating lease vehicles, financing receivables, restricted cash, and equity interests in certain SPEs) as collateral for our outstanding debt.\\nSchedule of Principal Maturities of Debt\\nThe future scheduled principal maturities of debt as of December 31, 2024 were as follows (in millions):\\nRecourse debt Non-recourse debt Total\\n2025 $ 4 $ 2,349 $ 2,353 \\n2026 ‚Äî 4,116 4,116 \\n2027 ‚Äî 699 699 \\n2028 ‚Äî 243 243 \\n2029 ‚Äî 95 95 \\nThereafter 3 398 401 \\nTotal $ 7 $ 7,900 $ 7,907 \\nNote 11 ‚Äì Leases\\nWe have entered into various operating and finance lease agreements for certain of our offices, manufacturing and warehouse facilities, retail and service locations, data centers, equipment, vehicles, and solar energy systems, worldwide. We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at inception and record the lease in our financial statements upon lease commencement, which is the date when the underlying asset is\\nmade available for use by the lessor.\\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and have elected to utilize the practical expedient to account for lease and non-lease components together as a single combined lease component, from both a lessee and lessor perspective with the exception of direct sales-type leases and production equipment classes embedded in supply agreements. From a lessor perspective, the timing and pattern of transfer are the\\nsame for the non-lease components and associated lease component and, the lease component, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating lease.\\nWe have elected not to present short-term leases on the consolidated balance sheet as these leases have a lease term of 12 months or less at lease inception and do not contain purchase options or renewal terms that we are reasonably certain to exercise. All other lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Because most of our leases do not\\nprovide an implicit rate of return, we used our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\\nOur leases, where we are the lessee, often include options to extend the lease term for up to 10 years. Some of our leases also include options to terminate the lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease term. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities, lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options.\\n75\\n--- Page 48 ---\\nLease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses depending on the nature of the leased asset. Certain operating leases provide for annual increases to lease payments based on an index or rate. We calculate the present value of future lease payments based on the index or rate at the lease commencement date for new leases. Differences between the\\ncalculated lease payment and actual payment are expensed as incurred. Amortization of finance lease assets is recognized over the lease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses depending on the nature of the leased asset. Interest expense on finance lease liabilities is recognized over the lease term within Interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\\nThe balances for the operating and finance leases where we are the lessee are presented as follows (in millions) within our consolidated balance sheets:\\nDecember 31, 2024 December 31, 2023\\nOperating leases:   \\nOperating lease right-of-use assets $ 5,160 $ 4,180 \\n \\nAccrued liabilities and other $ 807 $ 672 \\nOther long-term liabilities 4,603 3,671 \\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 5,410 $ 4,343 \\n \\nFinance leases:   \\nSolar energy systems, net $ 21 $ 23 \\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 350 601 \\nTotal finance lease assets $ 371 $ 624 \\n \\nCurrent portion of long-term debt and finance leases $ 113 $ 398 \\nLong-term debt and finance leases, net of current portion 222 175 \\nTotal finance lease liabilities $ 335 $ 573 \\nThe components of lease expense are as follows (in millions) within our consolidated statements of operations:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2024 2023 2022\\nOperating lease expense:    \\nOperating lease expense (1) $ 1,500 $ 1,153 $ 798 \\n \\nFinance lease expense:\\nAmortization of leased assets $ 409 $ 506 $ 493 \\nInterest on lease liabilities 21 45 72 \\nTotal finance lease expense $ 430 $ 551 $ 565 \\n \\nTotal lease expense $ 1,930 $ 1,704 $ 1,363 \\n(1) Includes short-term leases and variable lease costs, which are immaterial.\\n76\\n--- Page 49 ---\\nOther information related to leases where we are the lessee is as follows:\\nDecember 31, 2024 December 31, 2023\\nWeighted-average remaining lease term:\\nOperating leases 7.9 years 7.4 years\\nFinance leases 4.4 years 2.3 years\\n \\nWeighted-average discount rate:\\nOperating leases 5.3 % 5.6 %\\nFinance leases 4.7 % 5.5 %\\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases where we are the lessee is as follows (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2024 2023 2022\\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\\nOperating cash outflows from operating leases $ 1,450 $ 1,084 $ 754 \\nOperating cash outflows from finance leases (interest payments) $ 21 $ 47 $ 75 \\nLeased assets obtained in exchange for finance lease liabilities $ 144 $ 10 $ 58 \\nLeased assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities $ 1,808 $ 2,170 $ 1,059 \\nAs of December 31, 2024, the maturities of our operating and finance lease liabilities (excluding short-term leases) are as follows (in millions):\\n Operating\\nLeasesFinance\\nLeases\\n2025 $ 1,066 $ 122 \\n2026 958 84 \\n2027 843 69 \\n2028 742 27 \\n2029 642 22 \\nThereafter 2,428 45 \\nTotal minimum lease payments 6,679 369 \\nLess: Interest 1,269 34 \\nPresent value of lease obligations 5,410 335 \\nLess: Current portion 807 113 \\nLong-term portion of lease obligations $ 4,603 $ 222 \\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have excluded from the table above additional operating leases that have not yet commenced with aggregate rent payments of $1.10 billion.

The 2019 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, performance units and performance shares to our employees, directors and consultants. Stock options granted under the 2019 Plan may be either incentive stock options or nonstatutory stock options. Incentive stock options may only be granted to our\\nemployees. Nonstatutory stock options may be granted to our employees, directors and consultants. Generally, our stock options and RSUs vest over four years and our stock options are exercisable over a maximum period of 10 years from their grant dates.

The purchase price would be 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first and last trading days of each six-month offering period. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, under the ESPP we issued 2.2 million, 2.1 million and 1.4 million shares,\\nrespectively. As of December 31, 2024, there were 95.5 million shares available for issuance under the ESPP.\\nFair Value Assumptions\\nWe use the fair value method in recognizing stock-based compensation expense. Under the fair value method, we estimate the fair value of each stock option award with service or service and performance conditions and the ESPP on the grant date generally using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for stock options are as follows:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2024 2023 2022\\nRisk-free interest rate 3.92 % 3.90 % 3.11 %\\nExpected term (in years) 4.3 4.5 4.1\\nExpected volatility 59 % 63 % 63 %\\nDividend yield 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 %\\nGrant date fair value per share $ 114.29 $ 121.62 $ 114.51 \\nThe fair value of RSUs with service or service and performance conditions is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximating each grant‚Äôs expected life. We use our historical data in estimating the expected term of our employee grants. The expected volatility is based\\non the average of the implied volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock and the historical volatility of our common stock.\\n79\\n--- Page 52 ---\\nOther Performance-Based Grants\\nFrom time to time, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors grants certain employees performance-based RSUs and stock options.\\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $490 million under these grants to purchase or receive an aggregate 5.0 million shares of our common stock. For awards probable of achievement, we estimate the unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $421 million will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 4.0 years.\\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, stock-based compensation expense related to these grants, net of forfeitures, were not material.\\nSummary Stock-Based Compensation Information\\nThe following table summarizes our stock-based compensation expense by line item in the consolidated statements of operations (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2024 2023 2022\\nCost of revenues $ 776 $ 741 $ 594 \\nResearch and development 832 689 536 \\nSelling, general and administrative 389 382 430 \\nRestructuring and other $ 2 $ ‚Äî $ ‚Äî \\nTotal $ 1,999 $ 1,812 $ 1,560 \\nOur income tax benefits recognized from stock-based compensation arrangements were immaterial while we were under full valuation allowances on our U.S. deferred tax assets during the year ended December 31, 2022.

The valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets increased by $332 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, and decreased by $6.46 billion and $1.73\\nbillion during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The valuation allowance increase during the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to the changes of our California deferred tax assets, U.S. foreign tax credits and certain foreign operating losses. The change in valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the release of our valuation allowance with respect to our U.S.\\nfederal and certain state deferred tax assets. In the fourth quarter of 2023, based on the relevant weight of positive and negative evidence, including the amount of our taxable income in recent years which was objective and verifiable, and consideration of our expected future taxable earnings, we concluded that it is more likely than not that most of our U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets are realizable and released the valuation\\nallowance on these deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance change during the years ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to changes in our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities. Our deferred tax assets without a valuation allowance are more likely than not to be realized given the expectation of future earnings in the respective jurisdictions.\\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $4.34 billion of federal and $8.59 billion of state net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future taxable income, an immaterial amount of which, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2026 for federal and 2025 for state purposes. Federal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an ‚Äúownership\\nchange,‚Äù as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We have determined that no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards due to prior ownership changes or expirations.\\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had federal research and development tax credits of $1.48 billion, federal renewable energy tax credits of $1.01 billion, and state research and development tax credits of $1.06 billion. Most of our state research and development tax credits were in the state of California. If not utilized, some of the federal tax credits may expire in various amounts beginning in 2035. However, California research and\\ndevelopment tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely.\\nAs of December 31, 2024, we intend to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings and cash unless such repatriation results in no or minimal tax costs. We have recorded the taxes associated with the foreign earnings we intend to repatriate in the future. For the earnings we intend to indefinitely reinvest, no deferred tax liabilities for foreign withholding or other taxes have been recorded. The estimated amount of such unrecognized\\nwithholding tax liability associated with the indefinitely reinvested earnings is approximately $309 million.\\nUncertain Tax Positions\\nThe changes to our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows (in millions):\\nDecember 31, 2021 $ 531 \\nIncreases in balances related to prior year tax positions 136 \\nDecreases in balances related to prior year tax positions (12)\\nIncreases in balances related to current year tax positions 222 \\nDecreases in balances related to expiration of the statute of limitations (7)\\nDecember 31, 2022 870 \\nIncreases in balances related to prior year tax positions 59 \\nDecreases in balances related to settlement with tax authorities (6)\\nIncreases in balances related to current year tax positions 255 \\nDecreases in balances related to expiration of the statute of limitations (4)\\nDecember 31, 2023 1,174 \\nIncreases in balances related to prior year tax positions 51 \\nDecreases in balances related to prior year tax positions (27)\\nIncreases in balances related to current year tax positions 227 \\nDecreases in balances related to settlement with tax authorities (4)\\nDecreases in balances related to expiration of the statute of limitations (4)\\nDecember 31, 2024 $ 1,417 \\n83\\n--- Page 56 ---\\nWe include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, we have accrued $69\\nmillion and $47 million, respectively, related to interest and penalties on our unrecognized tax benefits. Unrecognized tax benefits of $1.14 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate.\\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (‚ÄúIRS‚Äù) for the years 2015 to 2018. Additional tax years within the periods 2004 to 2014 and 2019 to 2023 remain subject to examination for federal income tax purposes. All net operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject to adjustment for U.S. federal and state income\\ntax purposes. Our returns for 2004 and subsequent tax years remain subject to examination in U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions.\\nGiven the uncertainty in timing and outcome of our tax examinations, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change in gross unrecognized tax benefits within twelve months cannot be made at this time.\\nNote 14 ‚Äì Commitments and Contingencies\\nOperating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York\\nWe have an operating lease arrangement through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York.

On January 30, 2024, the Court issued an opinion finding that the 2018 CEO Performance Award should be rescinded. Plaintiff‚Äôs counsel filed a brief seeking a fee award of 29,402,900 Tesla shares, plus expenses of $1,120,115.50. Tesla opposed the fee request, and at Tesla‚Äôs 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, 72% of the disinterested voting shares of Tesla, excluding shares owned by Mr. Musk and\\nKimbal Musk, voted to ratify the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Because Tesla‚Äôs disinterested stockholders voted to ratify the 2018 CEO Performance Award, Mr. Musk and the other director defendants, joined by Tesla, filed a brief seeking to revise the Court‚Äôs January 30, 2024 opinion. On December 2, 2024, the Court issued an opinion denying the motion to revise the Court‚Äôs January 30, 2024 opinion and awarded Plaintiff‚Äôs counsel fees\\nin the amount of $345 million. A final judgment was entered by the Court, and the director defendants and Tesla appealed the decisions to the Delaware Supreme Court.\\nLitigation Related to Directors‚Äô Compensation\\nOn June 17, 2020, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla‚Äôs current and former directors regarding compensation awards granted to Tesla‚Äôs directors, other than Elon Musk, between 2017 and 2020. The suit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified\\ndamages and other relief. Defendants filed their answer on September 17, 2020.\\nOn July 14, 2023, the parties filed a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise and Settlement, which does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by any party. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Tesla provided notice of the proposed settlement to stockholders of record as of July 14, 2023. The Court held a hearing regarding the settlement on October 13, 2023, after which it took the settlement and plaintiff counsels‚Äô fee\\nrequest under advisement. On January 8, 2025, the Court approved the settlement and awarded Plaintiff‚Äôs counsel fees in the amount of approximately $176 million. A final judgment was entered by the Court on January 13, 2025. Tesla intends to appeal the Court‚Äôs fee award on or before the appeal deadline of February 12, 2025. The settlement is not expected to have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial\\nposition.\\nLitigation Relating to Potential Going Private Transaction\\nBetween August 10, 2018 and September 6, 2018, nine purported stockholder class actions were filed against Tesla and Elon Musk in connection with Mr. Musk‚Äôs August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. On January 16, 2019, Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and added as defendants the members of Tesla‚Äôs board of\\ndirectors. The consolidated complaint asserts claims for violations of the federal securities laws and seeks unspecified damages and other relief. The parties stipulated to certification of a class of stockholders, which the court granted on November 25, 2020. Trial started on January 17, 2023, and on February 3, 2023, a jury rendered a verdict in favor of the defendants on all counts. After trial, plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment as a matter of\\nlaw and a motion for new trial, which the Court denied and judgement was entered in favor of defendants on July 11, 2023. On November 6, 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court‚Äôs dismissal of all claims.\\nBetween October 17, 2018 and March 8, 2021, seven derivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of Tesla‚Äôs board of directors, as constituted at relevant times, in relation to statements made and actions connected to a potential going private transaction, with certain of the lawsuits challenging additional Twitter posts by Mr. Musk, among other\\nthings. Several of those actions were consolidated, and all have been stayed. In addition to these cases, two derivative lawsuits were filed on October 25, 2018 and February 11, 2019 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of the Tesla board of directors as then constituted. Those cases have also been consolidated and stayed.\\n85\\n--- Page 58 ---\\nOn October 21, 2022, a lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by a purported shareholder of Tesla alleging, among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their oversight of the Company‚Äôs 2018 settlement with the SEC, as amended. Among other things, the plaintiff seeks reforms to the Company‚Äôs corporate governance and internal procedures, unspecified damages, and\\nattorneys‚Äô fees. The lawsuit has been stayed pending resolution of a motion to consolidate certain derivative lawsuits in the Delaware Court of Chancery referenced below.\\nOn November 15, 2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank filed a lawsuit against Tesla in the Southern District of New York alleging breach of a stock warrant agreement that was entered into as part of a convertible notes offering in 2014. Tesla denied any wrongdoing and filed multiple counterclaims. On November 27, 2024, the parties agreed to settle their claims.\\nCertain Derivative Lawsuits in Delaware\\nBefore converting from a Delaware to Texas corporation on June 13, 2024, three separate derivative actions brought by purported Tesla stockholders were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery on May 24, June 10 and June 13, 2024, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against current and former directors regarding topics involving Elon Musk and others, X Corp. (formerly Twitter) and x.AI. These suits assert various claims, including\\nbreach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract, and seek unspecified damages and other relief. On August 6, 2024, the plaintiffs in these three actions moved to consolidate the matters into a single case. The Court consolidated two of the three cases.\\nLitigation and Investigations Relating to Alleged Discrimination and Harassment\\nOn February 9, 2022, the California Civil Rights Department (‚ÄúCRD,‚Äù formerly ‚ÄúDFEH‚Äù) filed a civil complaint against Tesla in Alameda County, California Superior Court, alleging systemic race discrimination, hostile work environment and pay equity claims, among others. CRD‚Äôs amended complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. The case is currently in discovery. Trial is scheduled for September 15, 2025.\\nAdditionally, on June 1, 2022 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (‚ÄúEEOC‚Äù) issued a cause finding against Tesla that closely parallels the CRD‚Äôs allegations. On September 28, 2023, the EEOC filed a civil complaint against Tesla in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California asserting claims for race harassment and retaliation and seeking, among other things, monetary and injunctive relief.\\nOn June 16, 2022, two Tesla stockholders filed separate derivative actions in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla‚Äôs current and former directors. Both suits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and violation of the federal securities laws in connection with alleged race and gender discrimination and sexual harassment. Among other things,\\nplaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages payable to Tesla, and attorneys‚Äô fees. On July 22, 2022, the Court consolidated the two cases and on September 6, 2022, plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. On November 7, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case and on September 15, 2023, the Court dismissed the action but granted plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint. On November 2, 2023,\\nplaintiff filed an amended complaint purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Elon Musk. On December 19, 2023, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint, which the Court granted on April 12, 2024, with leave for plaintiffs to amend. On May 15, 2024, plaintiffs filed a second amended consolidated complaint purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk. On July 1, 2024, the defendants moved to dismiss the second\\namended consolidated complaint.\\n86\\n--- Page 59 ---\\nOther Litigation Related to Our Products and Services\\nWe are also subject to various lawsuits that seek monetary and other injunctive relief. These lawsuits include proposed class actions and other consumer claims that allege, among other things, purported defects and misrepresentations related to our products and services. For example, on September 14, 2022, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. and related entities in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\\nCalifornia, alleging various claims about the Company‚Äôs driver assistance technology systems under state and federal law. This case was later consolidated with several other proposed class actions, and a Consolidated Amended Complaint was filed on October 28, 2022, which seeks damages and other relief on behalf of all persons who purchased or leased from Tesla between January 1, 2016, to the present. On October 5, 2022, a proposed\\nclass action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting similar state and federal law claims against the same defendants. On September 30, 2023, the Court dismissed this action with leave to amend the complaint. On November 20, 2023, the plaintiff moved to amend the complaint, which Tesla opposed. On August 8, 2024, the Court denied the plaintiff‚Äôs motion for leave to file an amended\\ncomplaint and entered judgment for Tesla. On September 5, 2024, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and the parties are briefing the matter. On March 22, 2023, the plaintiffs in the Northern District of California consolidated action filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to order Tesla to (1) cease using the term ‚ÄúFull Self-Driving Capability‚Äù (FSD Capability), (2) cease the sale\\nand activation of FSD Capability and deactivate FSD Capability on Tesla vehicles, and (3) provide certain notices to consumers about proposed court-findings about the accuracy of the use of the terms Autopilot and FSD Capability. Tesla opposed the motion. On September 30, 2023, the Court denied the request for a preliminary injunction, compelled four of five plaintiffs to arbitration, and dismissed the claims of the fifth plaintiff with leave\\nto amend the complaint. On October 31, 2023, the remaining plaintiff in the Northern District of California action filed an amended complaint, which Tesla moved to dismiss, and on May 15, 2024, the Court granted in part and denied in part Tesla‚Äôs motion. On October 2, 2023, a similar proposed class action was filed in San Diego County Superior Court in California. Tesla subsequently removed the San Diego County case to federal court\\nand on January 8, 2024, the federal court granted Tesla‚Äôs motion to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Tesla moved to compel arbitration, which the plaintiff did not oppose, and on June 27, 2024, the Court stayed the case pending arbitration.\\nOn February 27, 2023, a proposed class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla, Inc., Elon Musk and certain current and former Company executives. The complaint alleges that the defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions about the Company‚Äôs Autopilot and FSD Capability technologies and seeks money damages and other relief on behalf of persons who\\npurchased Tesla stock between February 19, 2019, and February 17, 2023. An amended complaint was filed on September 5, 2023, naming only Tesla, Inc. and Elon Musk as defendants. On November 6, 2023, Tesla moved to dismiss the amended complaint. On September 30, 2024, the Court granted Tesla‚Äôs motion to dismiss without prejudice. On November 26, 2024, the court issued a final judgment in Tesla‚Äôs favor, and on December 23,\\n2024, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\\nOn March 14, 2023, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Several similar complaints were also filed in the same court and these cases have now all been consolidated. These complaints allege that Tesla violates federal antitrust and warranty laws through its repair, service, and maintenance practices and seeks, among other relief, damages for persons who\\npaid Tesla for repairs services or Tesla compatible replacement parts from March 2019 to March 2023. On July 17, 2023, these plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. On September 27, 2023, the court granted Tesla‚Äôs motion to compel arbitration as to three of the plaintiffs, and on November 17, 2023, the court granted Tesla‚Äôs motion to dismiss without prejudice. The plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Second Amended Complaint on\\nDecember 12, 2023, which Tesla moved to dismiss. Plaintiffs also appealed the court‚Äôs arbitration order, which was denied. On June 17, 2024, the Court granted in part and denied in part Tesla‚Äôs motion to dismiss the Consolidated Second Amended Complaint.\\nThe Company intends to vigorously defend itself in these matters; however, we cannot predict the outcome or impact. We are unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims, unless noted.\\n87\\n--- Page 60 ---\\nCertain Investigations and Other Matters\\nWe regularly receive requests for information, including subpoenas, from regulators and governmental authorities such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission (‚ÄúSEC‚Äù), the Department of Justice (‚ÄúDOJ‚Äù), and various local, state, federal, and international agencies. The ongoing requests for information include topics such as operations,\\ntechnology (e.g., vehicle functionality, vehicle incidents, Autopilot and FSD Capability), compliance, finance, data privacy, and other matters related to Tesla‚Äôs business, its personnel, and related parties. We routinely cooperate with such formal and informal requests for information, investigations, and other inquiries. To our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. We\\ncannot predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters. Should the government decide to pursue an enforcement action, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, prospects, cash flows, financial position or brand.\\nWe are also subject to various other legal proceedings, risks and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities. For example, during the second quarter of 2023, a foreign news outlet reported that it obtained certain misappropriated data including, purportedly non-public Tesla business and personal information. Tesla has made notifications to potentially affected individuals (current and former employees) and regulatory\\nauthorities and we are working with certain law enforcement and other authorities. On August 5, 2023, a putative class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, purportedly on behalf of all U.S. individuals impacted by the data incident, followed by several additional lawsuits, that each assert claims under various state laws and seeks monetary damages and other relief. If an unfavorable ruling\\nor development were to occur in these or other possible legal proceedings, risks and claims, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position or brand.\\nLetters of Credit\\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $448 million of unused letters of credit outstanding.\\nNote 15 ‚Äì Variable Interest Entity Arrangements\\nWe have entered into various arrangements with investors to facilitate the funding and monetization of our solar energy systems and vehicles. In particular, our wholly owned subsidiaries and fund investors have formed and contributed cash and assets into various financing funds and entered into related agreements. We have determined that the funds are VIEs and we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs by reference to the power\\nand benefits criterion under ASC 810. We have considered the provisions within the agreements, which grant us the power to manage and make decisions that affect the operation of these VIEs, including determining the solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts to be sold or contributed to these VIEs, redeploying solar energy systems and managing customer receivables. We consider that the rights granted to the fund\\ninvestors under the agreements are more protective in nature rather than participating.\\nAs the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, we consolidate in the financial statements the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of these VIEs, and all intercompany balances and transactions between us and these VIEs are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Cash distributions of income and other receipts by a fund, net of agreed upon expenses, estimated expenses, tax benefits and detriments of income\\nand loss and tax credits, are allocated to the fund investor and our subsidiary as specified in the agreements.\\nGenerally, our subsidiary has the option to acquire the fund investor‚Äôs interest in the fund for an amount based on the market value of the fund or the formula specified in the agreements.\\nUpon the sale or liquidation of a fund, distributions would occur in the order and priority specified in the agreements.\\nPursuant to management services, maintenance and warranty arrangements, we have been contracted to provide services to the funds, such as operations and maintenance support, accounting, lease servicing and performance reporting. In some instances, we have guaranteed payments to the fund investors as specified in the agreements. A fund‚Äôs creditors have no recourse to our general credit or to that of other funds. Certain assets of\\nthe funds have been pledged as collateral for their obligations.\\n88\\n--- Page 61 ---\\nThe aggregate carrying values of the VIEs‚Äô assets and liabilities, after elimination of any intercompany transactions and balances, in the consolidated balance sheets were as follows (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2024December 31,\\n2023\\nAssets   \\nCurrent assets   \\nCash and cash equivalents $ 49 $ 66 \\nAccounts receivable, net 18 13 \\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 276 361 \\nTotal current assets 343 440 \\nOperating lease vehicles, net 392 ‚Äî \\nSolar energy systems, net 2,310 3,278 \\nOther non-current assets 183 369 \\nTotal assets $ 3,228 $ 4,087 \\nLiabilities   \\nCurrent liabilities   \\nAccrued liabilities and other $ 32 $ 67 \\nDeferred revenue 6 6 \\nCurrent portion of debt and finance leases 2,114 1,564 \\nTotal current liabilities 2,152 1,637 \\nDeferred revenue, net of current portion 71 99 \\nDebt and finance leases, net of current portion 1,834 2,041 \\nTotal liabilities $ 4,057 $ 3,777 \\nNote 16 ‚Äì Related Party Transactions\\nTesla periodically does business with certain entities with which its CEO and directors are affiliated, such as x.AI, SpaceX, The Boring Company, X Corp. and Redwood Materials, in accordance with our Related Person Transactions Policy.

Additionally, the automotive segment is also\\ncomprised of services and other, which includes sales of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services and collision, part sales, paid Supercharging, insurance services revenue and retail merchandise sales. The energy generation and storage segment includes the design, manufacture, installation, sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products and related services and sales of solar energy systems incentives.\\nOur CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset or liability information.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\\nNone.\\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ‚ÄúExchange Act‚Äù). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed\\nand operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\\nBased on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\\nperiods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\\nManagement‚Äôs Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\\naccepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are\\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\n91\\n--- Page 64 ---\\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control ‚Äì Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (‚ÄúCOSO‚Äù). Our management concluded\\nthat our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.\\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, as stated in their report which is included herein.\\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\\nBecause of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\\nITEM 9B.

Interim Financial Statements\\nThe consolidated financial statements of Tesla, Inc. (‚ÄúTesla‚Äù, the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù, ‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúus‚Äù or ‚Äúour‚Äù), including the consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2025, the consolidated statements of operations, the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, the consolidated statements of redeemable noncontrolling interests and equity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, and the consolidated statements of cash flows\\nfor the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, as well as other information disclosed in the accompanying notes, are unaudited. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024 was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The interim consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the annual consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes\\ncontained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\\nThe interim consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations for the periods presented. The consolidated results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative\\nof the results to be expected for the full year or for any other future years or interim periods.\\nReclassifications\\nCertain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenue by source\\nThe following table disaggregates our revenue by major source (in millions):\\n Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,\\n 2025 2024 2025 2024\\nAutomotive sales $ 15,787 $ 18,530 $ 28,712 $ 34,990 \\nAutomotive regulatory credits 439 890 1,034 1,332 \\nEnergy generation and storage sales 2,646 2,866 5,267 4,388 \\nServices and other 3,046 2,608 5,684 4,896 \\nTotal revenues from sales and services 21,918 24,894 40,697 45,606 \\nAutomotive leasing 435 458 882 934 \\nEnergy generation and storage leasing 143 148 252 261 \\nTotal revenues $ 22,496 $ 25,500 $ 41,831 $ 46,801 \\nAutomotive Segment\\nAutomotive Sales\\nDeferred revenue related to the access to our Full Self-Driving (‚ÄúFSD‚Äù) (Supervised) features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates primarily on automotive sales amounted to $3.75 billion and $3.60 billion as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.\\n10\\n--- Page 5 ---\\nTable of Contents\\nDeferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as of the balance sheet date. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balances as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $428 million and $482 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Of the total deferred revenue balance as of June 30, 2025, we expect to\\nrecognize $831 million of revenue in the next 12 months. The remaining balance will be recognized at the time of transfer of control of the product or over the performance period.\\nWe have financing receivables on our consolidated balance sheets related to loans we provide for financing our automotive deliveries. As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we had current net financing receivables of $236 million and $247 million, respectively, in Accounts receivable, net, and $670 million and $821 million, respectively, in Other non-current assets for the long-term portion.\\nWe offer resale value guarantees to our commercial banking partners in connection with certain vehicle leasing programs. Under these programs, we originate the lease with our end customer and immediately transfer the lease and the underlying vehicle to our commercial banking partner, with the transaction being accounted for as a sale under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\\nWe receive upfront payment for the vehicle, do not bear casualty and credit risks during the lease term, and we provide a guarantee capped to a limit if they are unable to sell the vehicle at or above the vehicle‚Äôs contractual or determined residual value at the end of the lease term. We estimate a guarantee liability in accordance with ASC 460, Guarantees and record it within other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. On a quarterly\\nbasis, we assess the estimated market value of vehicles sold under these programs to determine whether there have been changes to the amount of expected resale value guarantee liabilities. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. The total recorded guarantee liabilities on vehicles sold under these programs were immaterial as of\\nJune 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. Our maximum exposure on the guarantees we provide if they are unable to sell the vehicle at or above the vehicle‚Äôs contractual residual value at the end of the lease term was $2.46 billion and $1.45 billion as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.\\nAutomotive Regulatory Credits\\nAs of June 30, 2025, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $3.47 billion. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $880 million in the next 12 months and the rest over the remaining performance obligation period. Recent governmental and regulatory actions have repealed and/or restricted certain regulatory\\ncredit programs tied to our products, contributing to the $1.11 billion decrease in our remaining performance obligations as of June 30, 2025 compared to March 31, 2025. Additionally, changes in regulations on automotive regulatory credits may significantly impact our remaining performance obligations and revenue to be recognized under these contracts.\\nAutomotive Leasing Revenue\\nDirect Sales-Type Leasing Program\\nLease receivables relating to sales-type leases are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as follows (in millions):\\n June 30, 2025 December 31, 2024\\nGross lease receivables $ 382 $ 484 \\nUnearned interest income (25) (38)\\nAllowance for expected credit losses (6) (6)\\nNet investment in sales-type leases $ 351 $ 440 \\nReported as:\\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets $ 152 $ 152 \\nOther non-current assets 199 288 \\nNet investment in sales-type leases $ 351 $ 440 \\n11\\n--- Page 6 ---\\nTable of Contents\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Sales\\nWe record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are primarily related to prepayments from customers, which is recognized as revenue as or when the performance obligations are satisfied. As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $2.10 billion and $1.77 billion, respectively, mainly due to contractual payment terms. Revenue recognized from the deferred\\nrevenue balances as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $944 million and $873 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. We have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected contract length of one year or less. As of June 30, 2025, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations\\nthat were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $10.38 billion. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $5.47 billion in the next 12 months and the rest over the remaining performance obligation period. Changes in government and economic incentives or tariffs may impact the transaction price or our ability to execute these existing contracts.\\nWe have financing receivables on our consolidated balance sheets related to loans we provide for financing our energy products. As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we had current net financing receivables of $35 million and $34 million, respectively, in Accounts receivable, net, and $684 million and $658 million, respectively, in Other non-current assets for the long-term portion.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In\\ncompleting our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary differences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company‚Äôs projected\\nfuture results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future taxable income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of\\nfuture results considering all available information.\\nOur provision for income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if our estimated tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment.\\nNet Income per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders\\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to net income used in computing basic and diluted net income per share of common stock (in millions):\\nThree Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,\\n2025 2024 2025 2024\\nNet income attributable to common stockholders (1) $ 1,172 $ 1,400 $ 1,581 $ 2,790 \\nLess: Buy-outs of noncontrolling interest ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî (42)\\nNet income used in computing basic and diluted net income per share of common stock $ 1,172 $ 1,400 $ 1,581 $ 2,832 \\n(1) As a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2023-08, Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets, the previously reported periods in 2024 have been recast.

Our accounts receivable balances associated with sales of energy\\nstorage products are dependent on billing milestones and payment terms negotiated for each contract, and our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits are dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a significant\\nimpact on our accounts receivable balance from period to period. As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, government rebates receivable was $217 million and $315 million, respectively, in Accounts receivable, net.\\nFinancing Receivables\\nAs of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the vast majority of our financing receivables were at current status with an immaterial balance being past due. As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the majority of our financing receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2023 and 2022.\\n13\\n--- Page 8 ---\\nTable of Contents\\nAs of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable, net of allowance for expected credit losses, was $242 million and $248 million, respectively, of which immaterial amounts were due in the next 12 months. As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the allowance for expected credit losses was $33 million.\\nConcentration of Risk\\nCredit Risk\\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, investments, restricted cash, accounts receivable and other finance receivables. Our cash and investments balances are primarily on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions or invested in highly rated, investment-grade securities. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of June 30, 2025 and\\nDecember 31, 2024, no entity represented 10% or more of our total receivables balance.\\nSupply Risk\\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\\nWarranties\\nAccrued warranty activity consisted of the following (in millions):\\nThree Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,\\n2025 2024 2025 2024\\nAccrued warranty - beginning of period $ 7,214 $ 5,353 $ 6,716 $ 5,152 \\nWarranty costs incurred (398) (340) (790) (668)\\nNet changes in liability for pre-existing warranties, including expirations and foreign exchange impact 105 72 452 51 \\nProvision for warranty 591 710 1,134 1,260 \\nAccrued warranty - end of period $ 7,512 $ 5,795 $ 7,512 $ 5,795 \\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (‚ÄúFASB‚Äù) issued Accounting Standards Update (‚ÄúASU‚Äù) No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740). The ASU requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity‚Äôs effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income taxes paid. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and will likely\\nresult in the required additional disclosures being included in our consolidated financial statements on either a prospective or retrospective basis, once adopted.\\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (Subtopic 220-40). The ASU requires the disaggregated disclosure of specific expense categories, including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, and amortization, within relevant income statement captions. This ASU also requires disclosure of the total amount of selling expenses along with the definition of\\nselling expenses. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Adoption of this ASU can either be applied prospectively to consolidated financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date of this ASU or retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. Early adoption is also\\npermitted. This ASU will likely result in the required additional disclosures being included in our consolidated financial statements, once adopted.

Con. Res. 14. (‚Äúthe OBBBA‚Äù) was enacted. The OBBBA introduces multiple tax law and other legislative changes, including modifications to income tax provisions such as domestic research and development expenses, capital expenditures, and U.S. taxation of international earnings; the repeal or acceleration of the sunset of certain tax credits under\\nthe 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and elimination of certain penalties for violations of certain regulatory credit programs. We are currently evaluating the impact of these provisions on our consolidated financial statements, including loss of certain regulatory credit sales tied to our products and changes to the costs of our products.\\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\\nASU 2023-08\\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-08, Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60) (‚Äúnew crypto assets standard‚Äù). The new crypto assets standard requires certain crypto assets to be measured at fair value separately on the balance sheet with changes reported in the statement of operations each reporting period. The new crypto assets standard also enhances the other intangible asset disclosure\\nrequirements by requiring the name, cost basis, fair value, and number of units for each significant crypto asset holding. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we adopted the new crypto assets standard on a modified retrospective approach effective January 1, 2024. As such, the previously reported consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 have been recast to reflect the adoption of the new crypto assets\\nstandard.

As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes\\nwhich inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value.

Trial\\nwas held November 14-18, 2022. On January 30, 2024, the Court issued an opinion finding that the 2018 CEO Performance Award should be rescinded. Plaintiff‚Äôs counsel filed a brief seeking a fee award of 29,402,900 Tesla shares, plus expenses of $1,120,115.50. Tesla opposed the fee request, and at Tesla‚Äôs 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, 72% of the disinterested voting shares of Tesla, excluding shares owned by Mr. Musk and Kimbal\\nMusk, voted to ratify the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Because Tesla‚Äôs disinterested stockholders voted to ratify the 2018 CEO Performance Award, Mr. Musk and the other director defendants, joined by Tesla, filed a brief seeking to revise the Court‚Äôs January 30, 2024 opinion. On December 2, 2024, the Court issued an opinion denying the motion to revise the Court‚Äôs January 30, 2024 opinion and awarded Plaintiff‚Äôs counsel fees in the amount\\nof $345 million. A final judgment was entered by the Court, and the director defendants and Tesla appealed the decisions to the Delaware Supreme Court. Tesla and the Director Defendants filed their response briefs on March 11, 2025. Plaintiffs filed their opening brief on April 25, 2025, and reply briefs were filed on May 16, 2025. Therefore, the appeal has been fully briefed, but an oral argument date has not yet been set. If the appeal to the\\nDelaware Supreme Court were unsuccessful, it could result in a material adverse impact on our business and reported earnings due to the uncertainty and potentially significant costs associated with replacing or revising Mr. Musk‚Äôs compensation package, the types of which were described in our 2024 proxy statement.\\nLitigation Related to Directors‚Äô Compensation\\nOn June 17, 2020, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla‚Äôs current and former directors regarding compensation awards granted to Tesla‚Äôs directors, other than Elon Musk, between 2017 and 2020. The suit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages\\nand other relief. Defendants filed their answer on September 17, 2020.\\nOn July 14, 2023, the parties filed a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise and Settlement, which does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by any party. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Tesla provided notice of the proposed settlement to stockholders of record as of July 14, 2023. The Court held a hearing regarding the settlement on October 13, 2023, after which it took the settlement and Plaintiff‚Äôs counsel fees request\\nunder advisement. On January 8, 2025, the Court approved the settlement and awarded Plaintiff‚Äôs counsel fees in the amount of approximately $176 million. A final judgment was entered by the Court on January 13, 2025.\\nThe Company disagrees with the amount of attorneys‚Äô fees awarded by the court. On February 10, 2025, Tesla appealed the attorneys‚Äô fee award amount to the Delaware Supreme Court. Tesla did not appeal the Delaware Court of Chancery‚Äôs approval of the underlying settlement. Also on February 10, 2025, a single shareholder appealed the approval of the settlement. This shareholder‚Äôs appeal does not seek to alter any material terms (e.g.,\\nfinancial contributions or the defendants‚Äô obligations under the Settlement Agreement). The Delaware Court of Chancery had previously rejected this shareholder‚Äôs objections when approving the Settlement Agreement. Tesla‚Äôs appeal of the attorneys‚Äô fee award and the single shareholder‚Äôs appeal have been fully briefed. An oral argument date has not yet been set.\\nBecause neither Tesla‚Äôs appeal nor the shareholder‚Äôs appeal seeks to vacate the Settlement Agreement or materially modify its terms, the Company implemented the provisions of the Settlement Agreement in May 2025 by cancelling the options requiring cancellation under its terms.\\nIn connection with the settlement, Tesla received $277 million from certain directors and paid Plaintiff‚Äôs counsel fees of $176 million (which, as noted above, the Company is appealing) in the three months ended March 31, 2025. We have recorded a $31 million reversal of previously recognized stock-based compensation expense in association with the returned awards and increased our provision for income taxes in relation to the return of\\ndirectors‚Äô compensation. As the settlement was an equity transaction, the net impact to additional paid-in-capital was $110 million in the three months ended March 31, 2025.\\n21\\n--- Page 16 ---\\nTable of Contents\\nLitigation Relating to Potential Going Private Transaction\\nBetween October 17, 2018 and March 8, 2021, seven derivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of Tesla‚Äôs board of directors, as constituted at relevant times, in relation to statements made and actions connected to a potential going private transaction, with certain of the lawsuits challenging additional Twitter posts by Mr. Musk, among other things.\\nSeveral of those actions were consolidated, and all have been stayed. In addition to these cases, two derivative lawsuits were filed on October 25, 2018 and February 11, 2019 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of the Tesla board of directors as then constituted. Those cases were also consolidated, and on April 25, 2025, were dismissed with prejudice through a\\nstipulation and order.\\nOn October 21, 2022, a lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by a purported shareholder of Tesla alleging, among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their oversight of the Company‚Äôs 2018 settlement with the SEC, as amended. Among other things, the plaintiff seeks reforms to the Company‚Äôs corporate governance and internal procedures, unspecified damages, and attorneys‚Äô\\nfees. The lawsuit has been stayed.\\nCertain Derivative Lawsuits in Delaware\\nBefore converting from a Delaware to Texas corporation on June 13, 2024, three separate derivative actions brought by purported Tesla stockholders were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery on May 24, June 10 and June 13, 2024, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against current and former directors regarding topics involving Elon Musk and others, X Corp. (formerly Twitter) and x.AI. These suits assert various claims, including breach of\\nfiduciary duty and breach of contract, and seek unspecified damages and other relief. On August 6, 2024, the plaintiffs in these three actions moved to consolidate the matters into a single case. The Court consolidated two of the three cases. Tesla and the directors filed motions to dismiss on April 4, 2025. On June 10, 2025, the plaintiffs in the consolidated cases filed an opposition, and on that same date, the plaintiff in the case that was not\\nconsolidated filed an amended complaint.\\nLitigation and Investigations Relating to Alleged Discrimination and Harassment\\nOn February 9, 2022, the California Civil Rights Department (‚ÄúCRD,‚Äù formerly ‚ÄúDFEH‚Äù) filed a civil complaint against Tesla in Alameda County, California Superior Court, alleging systemic race discrimination, hostile work environment and pay equity claims, among others. CRD‚Äôs amended complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. The case is currently in discovery. No trial date is set but is expected to occur during 2026.\\nAdditionally, on June 1, 2022 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (‚ÄúEEOC‚Äù) issued a cause finding against Tesla that closely parallels the CRD‚Äôs allegations. On September 28, 2023, the EEOC filed a civil complaint against Tesla in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California asserting claims for race harassment and retaliation and seeking, among other things, monetary and injunctive relief. The case is\\nin discovery with no trial date set.\\n22\\n--- Page 17 ---\\nTable of Contents\\nOther Litigation Related to Our Products and Services\\nWe are also subject to various lawsuits that seek monetary and other injunctive relief. These lawsuits include proposed class actions and other consumer claims that allege, among other things, purported defects and misrepresentations related to our products and services. For example, on September 14, 2022, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. and related entities in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California,\\nalleging various claims about the Company‚Äôs driver assistance technology systems under state and federal law. This case was later consolidated with several other proposed class actions, and a Consolidated Amended Complaint was filed on October 28, 2022, which seeks damages and other relief on behalf of all persons who purchased or leased from Tesla between January 1, 2016, to the present. On October 5, 2022, a proposed class action\\ncomplaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting similar state and federal law claims against the same defendants. On September 30, 2023, the Court dismissed this action with leave to amend the complaint. On November 20, 2023, the plaintiff moved to amend the complaint, which Tesla opposed. On August 8, 2024, the Court denied the plaintiff‚Äôs motion for leave to file an amended complaint and entered\\njudgment for Tesla. On September 5, 2024, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and oral argument occurred on March 20, 2025. On April 25, 2025, the Second Circuit affirmed the lower court‚Äôs order and dismissed the case. On March 22, 2023, the plaintiffs in the Northern District of California consolidated action filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to order Tesla to (1) cease using the\\nterm ‚ÄúFull Self-Driving Capability‚Äù (FSD Capability), (2) cease the sale and activation of FSD Capability and deactivate FSD Capability on Tesla vehicles, and (3) provide certain notices to consumers about proposed court-findings about the accuracy of the use of the terms Autopilot and FSD Capability. Tesla opposed the motion. On September 30, 2023, the Court denied the request for a preliminary injunction, compelled four of five plaintiffs to\\narbitration, and dismissed the claims of the fifth plaintiff with leave to amend the complaint. On October 31, 2023, the remaining plaintiff in the Northern District of California action filed an amended complaint, which Tesla moved to dismiss, and on May 15, 2024, the Court granted in part and denied in part Tesla‚Äôs motion. On May 6, 2025, the plaintiff filed a motion for class certification, which has been fully briefed, and a hearing is scheduled for\\nAugust 12, 2025. On October 2, 2023, a similar proposed class action was filed in San Diego County Superior Court in California. Tesla subsequently removed the San Diego County case to federal court and on January 8, 2024, the federal court granted Tesla‚Äôs motion to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Tesla moved to compel arbitration, which the plaintiff did not oppose, and on June 27, 2024, the\\nCourt stayed the case pending arbitration.\\nOn February 27, 2023, a proposed class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla, Inc., Elon Musk and certain current and former Company executives. The complaint alleges that the defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions about the Company‚Äôs Autopilot and FSD Capability technologies and seeks money damages and other relief on behalf of persons who purchased\\nTesla stock between February 19, 2019, and February 17, 2023. An amended complaint was filed on September 5, 2023, naming only Tesla, Inc. and Elon Musk as defendants. On November 6, 2023, Tesla moved to dismiss the amended complaint. On September 30, 2024, the Court granted Tesla‚Äôs motion to dismiss without prejudice. On November 26, 2024, the court issued a final judgment in Tesla‚Äôs favor, and on December 23, 2024, the plaintiffs\\nfiled a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The appeal has been fully briefed, and the parties are awaiting a date for oral argument.\\nOn March 14, 2023, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Several similar complaints were also filed in the same court and these cases have now all been consolidated. These complaints allege that Tesla violates federal antitrust and warranty laws through its repair, service, and maintenance practices and seeks, among other relief, damages for persons who paid\\nTesla for repairs services or Tesla compatible replacement parts from March 2019 to March 2023. On July 17, 2023, these plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. On September 27, 2023, the court granted Tesla‚Äôs motion to compel arbitration as to three of the plaintiffs, and on November 17, 2023, the court granted Tesla‚Äôs motion to dismiss without prejudice. The plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Second Amended Complaint on December\\n12, 2023, which Tesla moved to dismiss. Plaintiffs also appealed the court‚Äôs arbitration order, which was denied. On June 17, 2024, the Court granted in part and denied in part Tesla‚Äôs motion to dismiss the Consolidated Second Amended Complaint. On February 18, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a Third Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint that removed the claims for monetary damages. On June 9, 2025, pursuant to the parties‚Äô stipulated\\nmotion, the court dismissed the case with prejudice.\\nThe Company intends to vigorously defend itself in these matters; however, we cannot predict the outcome or impact. We are unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims, unless noted.\\n23\\n--- Page 18 ---\\nTable of Contents\\nCertain Investigations and Other Matters\\nWe regularly receive requests for information, including subpoenas, from regulators and governmental authorities such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission (‚ÄúSEC‚Äù), the Department of Justice (‚ÄúDOJ‚Äù), and various local, state, federal, and international agencies. The ongoing requests for information include topics such as operations,\\ntechnology (e.g., vehicle functionality, vehicle incidents, Autopilot and FSD Capability and Robotaxi), compliance, finance, data privacy, and other matters related to Tesla‚Äôs business, its personnel, and related parties. We routinely cooperate with such formal and informal requests for information, investigations, and other inquiries. To our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred.\\nWe cannot predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters. Should the government decide to pursue an enforcement action, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position or brand.\\nWe are also subject to various other legal proceedings, risks and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities. For example, during the second quarter of 2023, a foreign news outlet reported that it obtained certain misappropriated data including, purportedly non-public Tesla business and personal information. Tesla made notifications to potentially affected individuals (current and former employees) and regulatory authorities\\nand worked with certain law enforcement and other authorities. On August 5, 2023, a putative class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, purportedly on behalf of all U.S. individuals impacted by the data incident, followed by several additional lawsuits, that each assert claims under various state laws and seeks monetary damages and other relief. If an unfavorable ruling or development were to\\noccur in these or other possible legal proceedings, risks and claims, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position or brand.\\nNote 11 ‚Äì Variable Interest Entity Arrangements\\nThe aggregate carrying values of the variable interest entities‚Äô assets and liabilities, after elimination of any intercompany transactions and balances, in the consolidated balance sheets were as follows (in millions):\\nJune 30,\\n2025December 31,\\n2024\\nAssets   \\nCurrent assets   \\nCash and cash equivalents $ 59 $ 49 \\nAccounts receivable, net 27 18 \\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 250 276 \\nTotal current assets 336 343 \\nOperating lease vehicles, net 340 392 \\nSolar energy systems, net 2,241 2,310 \\nOther non-current assets 191 183 \\nTotal assets $ 3,108 $ 3,228 \\nLiabilities   \\nCurrent liabilities   \\nAccrued liabilities and other $ 35 $ 32 \\nDeferred revenue 6 6 \\nCurrent portion of debt and finance leases 1,748 2,114 \\nTotal current liabilities 1,789 2,152 \\nDeferred revenue, net of current portion 63 71 \\nDebt and finance leases, net of current portion 1,422 1,834 \\nTotal liabilities $ 3,274 $ 4,057 \\n24\\n--- Page 19 ---\\nTable of Contents\\nNote 12 ‚Äì Segment Reporting and Information about Geographic Areas\\nWe have two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.

MANAGEMENT‚ÄôS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nOverview\\nOur mission is to accelerate the world‚Äôs transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance, installation, operation, charging, insurance, financial and other services related to our products. Additionally, we are increasingly focused on products and services based on AI, robotics and\\nautomation.\\nAs a result of rapidly evolving trade and fiscal policy, uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase, posing risks to our global supply chain and cost structure which could have a meaningfully adverse impact on demand for our products and our profitability. The current tariff regime will have a relatively larger impact on our energy generation and storage business compared to our automotive business. While we\\nprepare for near-term challenges to our business under current policies, we are focused on long-term growth opportunities as we continue to make prudent investments.\\nIn 2025, we produced approximately 773,000 consumer vehicles and delivered approximately 721,000 consumer vehicles through the second quarter. We are focused on profitable growth, including by leveraging existing factories and production lines to introduce new and more affordable products and services, further improving and deploying our FSD (Supervised) capabilities, including future autonomous capabilities through our purpose-\\nbuilt Robotaxi product, Cybercab, reducing costs, increasing vehicle production, utilized capacity and delivery capabilities, improving and developing our vehicles, battery and AI compute technologies, vertically integrating and localizing our supply chain, and expanding our global infrastructure, including our service and charging infrastructure. In June 2025, we launched our Robotaxi service in Austin, capitalizing on our AI investments and\\nscalable mobility infrastructure to advance a service-driven business model.\\nIn 2025, we deployed 20.0 GWh of energy storage products through the second quarter. We are focused on ramping the production, increasing the market penetration of our energy storage products, developing our battery technologies and vertically integrating, localizing and expanding our supply chain.\\nDuring the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, we recognized total revenues of $22.50 billion and $41.83 billion, respectively, representing decreases of $3.00 billion and $4.97 billion, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, our net income attributable to common stockholders was $1.17 billion and $1.58 billion, respectively, representing decreases of\\n$228 million and $1.21 billion, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. We continue to ramp production and build and optimize our manufacturing capacity, expand our operations while focusing on further cost reductions and operational efficiencies to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products, and invest in research and development to accelerate our AI, software, and fleet-based profits for further revenue\\ngrowth.\\nWe ended the second quarter of 2025 with $36.78 billion in cash and cash equivalents and investments, representing an increase of $219 million from the end of 2024. Our cash flows provided by operating activities were $4.70 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to $3.85 billion during the same period ended June 30, 2024, representing an increase of $842 million. Capital expenditures amounted to $3.89 billion\\nduring the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to $5.05 billion during the same period ended June 30, 2024, representing a decrease of $1.16 billion. Overall growth has allowed our business to generally fund itself, and we will continue to make critical high-value investments while maintaining a strong balance sheet.\\n26\\n--- Page 21 ---\\nTable of Contents\\nManagement Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2025 Outlook\\nAutomotive‚ÄîProduction\\nThe following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under development, as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q:\\nProduction Location Vehicle Model(s) Production Status\\nFremont Factory Model S / Model X Active\\n Model 3 / Model Y Active\\nGigafactory Shanghai Model 3 / Model Y Active\\nGigafactory Berlin-Brandenbur g Model Y Active\\nGigafactory Texas Model Y Active\\n Cybertruck Active\\nCybercab Construction\\nGigafactory Nevada Tesla Semi Construction\\nTBD Roadster In development\\nWe are focused on growing and optimizing our manufacturing capacity, which includes capacity for manufacturing newer vehicle models and future vehicles utilizing aspects of our next generation platform, while maximizing production rate and efficiency at our Gigafactories. Our factories are also preparing for the release of new models later this year. The next phase of production growth will be initiated by advances in autonomy and the\\nintroduction of new products, including those built on our next generation vehicle platform, as well as our ability to manufacture our own cells that we are developing to have high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease production costs and increase affordability and customer awareness.\\nThese plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by new product and manufacturing technologies we introduce, the number of concurrent international projects, any industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages and any future impact from events outside of our control. For example, changes to fiscal and trade policy with respect to tariffs, export controls\\nand other restrictions may impact our global supply chain cost structure and availability, affecting not only vehicle production, but also facility expansions. Moreover, we have set ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles.\\nAutomotive‚ÄîDemand, Sales, Deliveries and Infrastructure\\nOur cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies, and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles‚Äô affordability and have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles. We will also continue to generate demand by improving our vehicles‚Äô performance and functionality, including through product offerings and features utilizing artificial intelligence such as Autopilot, FSD (Supervised), and other software,\\nand delivering new vehicles and vehicle options. In addition, we believe the launch of our Robotaxi service in June 2025 will unlock significant business growth to advance a service-driven business model. We will continue to improve safety and profitability while scaling the network. In addition, we have been increasing awareness, and expanding our vehicle financing programs, including attractive leasing terms for our customers.\\nHowever, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to shifting consumer trends, political and regulatory uncertainty, including with respect to trade and the environment, all of which can be compounded by inflationary pressures, rising energy prices, interest rate fluctuations and the liquidity of enterprise customers. For example, as inflationary pressures increased across the markets in which we operate, central banks in developed\\ncountries raised interest rates rapidly and substantially, which impacted the affordability of vehicle lease and finance arrangements. Further, sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our operations. Moreover, as additional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to\\nadjust and continue to execute well to maintain our momentum. Additionally, our suppliers‚Äô liquidity and allocation plans may be affected by current challenges in the automotive industry, which could reduce our access to components or result in unfavorable changes to cost. These macroeconomic and industry trends have had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on the pricing of, and order rate for our vehicles, and in turn our operating\\nmargin.\\n27\\n--- Page 22 ---\\nTable of Contents\\nChanges in government and economic policies, incentives or tariffs may also impact our production, cost structure and the competitive landscape. While the final scope and application of recently announced changes in trade policy remain uncertain at this time, higher tariffs on imports and subsequent retaliatory tariffs could adversely impact consumer spending and demand for durable goods and related services. Furthermore, certain\\nprovisions of the recently signed OBBBA, including the removal of tax credits for electric vehicles, may also impact consumer demand for electric vehicles in general once effective. We will continue to adjust accordingly to such developments, and we believe our ongoing cost reduction efforts, including through production innovation, process improvements and logistics optimization, and focus on operating leverage, vertical integration and supply\\nchain localization will continue to benefit us in relation to our competitors. Our new products, which will include more affordable options, and our advances in autonomy, position us for future growth.\\nAs our production increases, we must work constantly to similarly increase vehicle delivery capability so that it does not become a bottleneck on our total deliveries. We are also committed to reducing the percentage of vehicles delivered in the third month of each quarter, which will help to reduce the cost per vehicle. As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will also have to continue to increase and staff our delivery,\\nservicing and charging infrastructure accordingly, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction. In particular, as other automotive manufacturers have announced their adoption of the North American Charging Standard (‚ÄúNACS‚Äù) and agreements with us to utilize our Superchargers, we must correspondingly expand our network in order to ensure adequate availability\\nto meet customer demands. We also remain focused on continued enhancements of the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations. In tandem with the launch of our Robotaxi business, we are focused on developing and optimizing dedicated infrastructure, including in relation to vehicle cleaning and maintenance, charging, security, teleoperations and fleet management, to ensure service quality as we continue to scale.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment\\nThe long-term success of this business is dependent upon incremental volume growth. We continue to increase the production and capabilities of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand, including the ramps of our Megafactories in Shanghai and Lathrop, California, and the construction of a new Megafactory near Houston, Texas. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter\\ndepending on the timing of specific project milestones and logistics. As these product lines grow, we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products. At the same time, changes in government and economic incentives or tariffs may also impact our sales, cost structure and the competitive landscape. For instance, the recently announced import tariffs by the US government and the provisions of the OBBBA could\\nsignificantly increase battery cell expenses and impact costs for our consumers, negatively impacting consumer demand. Despite these challenges, as AI infrastructure drives rapid load growth, we see opportunities for our energy storage products to stabilize the grid, shift energy when it is needed most and provide additional power capacity.\\nCash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends\\nOur capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short-term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time, and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions and shifting global trade and fiscal policy. We are simultaneously developing and ramping new products, building or ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents, piloting the development and manufacture of\\nnew battery cell technologies, expanding our Supercharger network and investing in autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled training and products, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects. While we prepare for near-term\\nchallenges to our business under current policies, we are focused on long-term growth opportunities as we continue to make critical, high-value investments while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development, all other continuing infrastructure growth and varying levels of inflation, we currently expect our capital expenditures to exceed $9.00 billion in 2025.\\nChanges in fiscal and trade policy may necessitate adjustments to our project timelines, potentially impacting our cash flow and capital expenditure expectations.\\n28\\n--- Page 23 ---\\nTable of Contents\\nOur business has generally been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also generally facilitating positive cash generation. We have and will continue to utilize such cash flows, among other things, to invest in autonomy, further vertically integrate our\\nsupply chain, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers. At the same time, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and other potential variables such as rising material prices and increases in supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability. Overall, we\\nexpect our ability to be self-funding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales.\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\nFor a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to Part II, Item 7, Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nSee Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nResults of Operations\\nRevenues\\n Three Months Ended June 30, Change Six Months Ended June 30, Change\\n(Dollars in millions) 2025 2024 $ % 2025 2024 $ %\\nAutomotive sales $ 15,787 $ 18,530 $ (2,743) (15)% $ 28,712 $ 34,990 $ (6,278) (18)%\\nAutomotive regulatory credits 439 890 (451) (51)% 1,034 1,332 (298) (22)%\\nAutomotive leasing 435 458 (23) (5)% 882 934 (52) (6)%\\nTotal automotive revenues 16,661 19,878 (3,217) (16)% 30,628 37,256 (6,628) (18)%\\nServices and other 3,046 2,608 438 17 % 5,684 4,896 788 16 %\\nTotal automotive & services and other segment revenue 19,707 22,486 (2,779) (12)% 36,312 42,152 (5,840) (14)%\\nEnergy generation and storage segment revenue 2,789 3,014 (225) (7)% 5,519 4,649 870 19 %\\nTotal revenues $ 22,496 $ 25,500 $ (3,004) (12)% $ 41,831 $ 46,801 $ (4,970) (11)%\\nAutomotive & Services and Other Segment\\nAutomotive sales revenue decreased $2.74 billion, or 15%, in the three months ended June 30, 2025 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, due to a decrease of approximately 45,000 combined Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries and a decrease of approximately 12,000 deliveries of other models. Additionally, we had a lower average selling price per unit driven by sales mix.\\nAutomotive sales revenue decreased $6.28 billion, or 18%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2024, due to a decrease of approximately 95,000 combined Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries in part from bringing down all of our vehicle factories simultaneously for the changeover to New Model Y and a decrease of approximately 16,000 deliveries of other models. Additionally, we had a\\nlower average selling price per unit driven by sales mix and higher customer incentives such as attractive financing options.\\nAutomotive regulatory credits revenue decreased $451 million, or 51%, in the three months ended June 30, 2025 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. Automotive regulatory credits revenue decreased $298 million, or 22%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2024. Fluctuations in automotive regulatory credits are impacted by our supply of credits, subject to changes in\\nregulation, production and sales. Furthermore, we are impacted by the demand for credits by other automobile manufacturers.\\n29\\n--- Page 24 ---\\nTable of Contents\\nServices and other revenue increased $438 million, or 17%, in the three months ended June 30, 2025 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024.

The changes are due to mark-to-market on our bitcoin digital assets and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on\\nour intercompany balances. As our intercompany balances are significant in nature and we do not typically hedge foreign currency risk, we can experience significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses from period to period.\\nProvision for Income Taxes\\nThree Months Ended June 30, Change Six Months Ended June 30, Change\\n(Dollars in millions) 2025 2024 $ % 2025 2024 $ %\\nProvision for income taxes $ 359 $ 371 $ (12) (3)% $ 528 $ 854 $ (326) (38)%\\nEffective tax rate 23 % 21 % 25 % 23 %\\nOur provision for income taxes decreased by $12 million in the three months ended June 30, 2025 and decreased by $326 million in the six months ended June 30, 2025 as compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to the change in our pre-tax income year over year. Our effective tax rate increased from 21% to 23% in the three months ended June 30, 2025 and increased from 23% to 25% in the six\\nmonths ended June 30, 2025 as compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to the changes in the mix of our jurisdictional earnings.\\nSee Note 9, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details.\\n32\\n--- Page 27 ---\\nTable of Contents\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\nWe expect to continue to generate net positive operating cash flow. The cash we generate from our core operations enables us to fund ongoing operations and production, our research and development projects for new products and technologies including our proprietary battery cells, additional manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturing facilities, the construction of future factories, and the continued expansion of our retail and service\\nlocations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, Supercharger, including to support NACS, energy product installation capabilities and autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled products.\\nIn addition, because a large portion of our future expenditures will be to fund our growth, we expect that if needed we will be able to adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment. For example, if our near-term manufacturing operations decrease in scale or ramp more slowly than expected, including due to global economic, tax, trade or business conditions, we may choose to correspondingly slow the pace of our capital\\nexpenditures. Finally, we continually evaluate our cash needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources to fund the rapid growth of our business, including through drawdowns on existing or new debt facilities or financing funds. Conversely, we may also from time to time determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily repay certain indebtedness early.\\nAccordingly, we believe that our current sources of funds will provide us with adequate liquidity during the 12-month period following June 30, 2025, as well as in the long-term.\\nSee the sections below for more details regarding the material requirements for cash in our business and our sources of liquidity to meet such needs.\\nMaterial Cash Requirements\\nFrom time to time in the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with vendors for the purchase of components and raw materials to be used in the manufacture of our products. However, due to contractual terms, variability in the precise growth curves of our development and production ramps, and opportunities to renegotiate pricing, we generally do not have binding and enforceable purchase orders under such contracts beyond\\nthe short-term, and the timing and magnitude of purchase orders beyond such period is difficult to accurately project.\\nAs discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in Part I, Item 2, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations‚ÄîManagement Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2025 Outlook‚ÄîCash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we currently expect our capital expenditures to support our projects globally to exceed $9.00 billion in 2025.\\nChanges in trade policy may necessitate adjustments to our project timelines, potentially impacting our capital expenditure expectations.\\nAs of June 30, 2025, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $6.98 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, of which $1.97 billion is current. For details regarding our indebtedness, refer to Note 7, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nSources and Conditions of Liquidity\\nOur sources to fund our material cash requirements are predominantly from our deliveries and servicing of new and used vehicles, sales and installations of our energy storage products, interest income, and proceeds from debt facilities and equity offerings, when applicable.\\nAs of June 30, 2025, we had $15.59 billion and $21.20 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, respectively. Balances held in foreign currencies had a U.S. dollar equivalent of $2.70 billion and consisted primarily of Chinese yuan and euros. We had $5.00 billion of unused committed credit amounts as of June 30, 2025. For details regarding our indebtedness, refer to Note 7, Debt, to the consolidated financial\\nstatements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nWe continue adapting our strategy to meet our liquidity and risk objectives, such as investing in U.S. government securities and other investments, investing in autonomy, further vertically integrating our supply chain, expanding our product roadmap and providing financing options to our customers.\\n33\\n--- Page 28 ---\\nTable of Contents\\nSummary of Cash Flows\\n Six Months Ended June 30,\\n(Dollars in millions) 2025 2024\\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 4,696 $ 3,854 \\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (4,595) $ (8,309)\\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities $ (554) $ 2,736 \\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $842 million to $4.70 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2025 from $3.85 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2024. This increase was primarily due to favorable changes in net operating assets and liabilities of $1.30 billion, partially offset by a decrease in net income excluding non-cash expenses, gains and losses of $454 million.\\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\\nNet cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures, which were $3.89 billion and $5.05 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, mainly for AI-related capital expenditures, global factory expansion, machinery and equipment as we expand and enhance our product roadmap. We also purchased $709 million and $3.26 billion of short-term\\ninvestments, net of proceeds from maturities and sales, for the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\\nNet cash flows from financing activities changed by $3.29 billion to $554 million net cash outflows during the six months ended June 30, 2025 from $2.74 billion net cash inflows during the six months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a $2.91 billion increase in repayments of debt and a $845 million decrease in proceeds from issuances of debt. See Note 7, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included\\nelsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details regarding our debt obligations. Additionally, the decrease was partially offset by a $139 million decrease in principal payments on finance leases, a $124 million decrease in payments for buy-outs of noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and $101 million of proceeds received from directors in shareholder settlement net of payment for related legal fees during the six months ended\\nJune 30, 2025.\\n34\\n--- Page 29 ---\\nTable of Contents\\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\\nForeign Currency Risk\\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the Chinese yuan and euro in relation to our current year operations). In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar for our foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates affect our\\noperating results as expressed in U.S. dollars as we do not typically hedge foreign currency risk.\\nWe have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency (primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances).\\nWe considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term. These changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet date to compute the impact these changes would have had\\non our net income before income taxes. These changes would have resulted in a gain or loss of $1.31 billion at June 30, 2025 and $1.15 billion at December 31, 2024, assuming no foreign currency hedging.\\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ‚ÄúExchange Act‚Äù). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and\\noperated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\\nBased on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of June 30, 2025, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods\\nspecified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2025, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\\n35\\n--- Page 30 ---\\nTable of Contents\\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\\nFor a description of our material pending legal proceedings, please see Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, and Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and future results. Other than the risk factors\\nset forth below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors discussed in our Annual and Quarterly Reports.\\nDemand for our products and services and our financial results may be impacted by the status of government and economic incentives supporting the development and adoption of such products.\\nGovernment and economic incentives that support the development and adoption of electric vehicles in the U.S. and abroad, including certain tax exemptions, tax credits and rebates, may be reduced, eliminated, amended or exhausted from time to time. For example, previously available incentives favoring electric vehicles in certain areas have expired or were cancelled or temporarily unavailable, and in some cases were not eventually\\nreplaced or reinstituted, which may have negatively impacted sales. Specifically, recent governmental and regulatory actions have repealed and/or restricted consumer, manufacturing and charging infrastructure tax credits, and certain regulatory credit programs tied to our products. These, and any similar actions in the future, may affect demand for our vehicles, and harm our growth, prospects and operating results, and the loss of previously\\navailable tax credits and carbon offset mechanisms may further negatively impact our financial results. In addition, certain government and economic incentives may also be implemented or amended to provide benefits to manufacturers who assemble domestically, have local suppliers or have other characteristics that may not apply to Tesla. Such developments could negatively impact demand for our vehicles, and we and our customers may have to\\nadjust to them, including through pricing modifications.\\nIn addition, certain governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives that are currently available with respect to our solar and energy storage product businesses allow us to lower our costs and encourage customers to buy our products and investors to invest in our solar financing funds. However, these incentives may expire when the allocated funding is exhausted, reduced or terminated as renewable energy adoption rates\\nincrease, sometimes without warning. For example, provisions of the OBBBA could affect battery cell expenses and impact costs for our consumers, negatively impacting demand. Likewise, in jurisdictions where net metering is currently available, our customers receive bill credits from utilities for energy that their solar energy systems generate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use. The benefit available under net metering has\\nbeen or has been proposed to be reduced, altered or eliminated in several jurisdictions, and has also been contested and may continue to be contested before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Any reductions or terminations of such incentives may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results by making our products less competitive for customers, increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our ability to\\nattract investment partners and to form new financing funds for our solar and energy storage assets.\\nITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\\nNone.\\nITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES\\nNone.\\nITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\\nNot applicable.\\nITEM 5.

The Special Committee is comprised of disinterested directors Robyn Denholm and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson.\\n \\nOn August 3, 2025, the Company approved an award of 96 million shares of restricted stock (the ‚Äú2025 CEO Interim Award‚Äù) to Mr. Musk under the Company‚Äôs 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the ‚Äú2019 Plan‚Äù). The shares underlying the 2025 CEO Interim Award will be issued upon termination or expiration of the waiting\\nperiod or periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the ‚ÄúHSR Act‚Äù). The 2025 CEO Interim Award was recommended by the Special Committee on August 1, 2025, and approved by the Board, with Mr. Musk and Kimbal Musk recusing, on August 3, 2025.\\n \\nSummary of the 2025 CEO Interim Award\\n \\nThe 2025 CEO Interim Award consists of the following key terms:\\n \\n¬∑Number of Shares: 96 million shares of common stock.\\n \\n¬∑Vesting Schedule: The 2025 CEO Interim Award will vest upon the second anniversary of August 3, 2025 (the ‚ÄúDate of Grant‚Äù), subject to Mr. Musk remaining in continuous service as CEO or as an executive officer responsible for product development or operations (as approved by the Board‚Äôs disinterested\\ndirectors) through such second anniversary (‚ÄúEligible Service‚Äù).\\n \\n¬∑Early Forfeiture: The 2025 CEO Interim Award will be immediately forfeited and returned to the Company if, prior to vesting, there is a final, non-appealable judgment, order or decision of the Delaware courts with respect to the action captioned Tornetta v. Elon Musk et al., C.A. No. 2018-0408-KSJM (Del. Ch.),\\nor any pending or future appeal, including In re Tesla, Inc. Derivative Litigation, Nos. 10, 2025, 11, 2025 (Del.) (a ‚ÄúTornetta Decision Event‚Äù) that results in Mr. Musk becoming able to exercise in full the performance-based stock option award he was granted in January 2018 (the ‚Äú2018 CEO Award‚Äù).\\n \\n¬∑Purchase Price: Mr. Musk must pay the Company $23.34 per share of restricted stock that vests (the ‚ÄúPurchase Price‚Äù), which is equal to the exercise price per share of the 2018 CEO Award.\\n \\n¬∑Holding Period: Mr. Musk will not sell, transfer or dispose of the shares covered by the 2025 CEO Interim Award until after the fifth anniversary of the Date of Grant, except (i) as required to satisfy taxes due in respect to vesting of the 2025 CEO Interim Award, pay the Purchase Price or both, (ii) in transactions\\nthat involve merely a change of form in which Mr. Musk owns the shares covered by the 2025 CEO Interim Award or (iii) as may be permitted by the disinterested directors of the Board acting as administrator, consistent with the Company‚Äôs internal policies (with any sales for the purposes described in (i) and\\n(ii) to be conducted through an orderly disposition in coordination with the Company).\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n¬∑No Double Dip: If there is a Tornetta Decision Event that results in Mr. Musk becoming able to exercise options covered by the 2018 CEO Award, but does not result in Early Forfeiture, then: (i) if the Tornetta Decision Event occurs prior to vesting, shares covered by the 2025 CEO Interim Award will be reduced\\nto the extent that (a) the sum of the 2025 CEO Interim Award shares and any amount of options exercisable under the 2018 CEO Award exceeds (b) the total number of options subject to the 2018 CEO Award in full (the ‚ÄúExcess Amount‚Äù); and (ii) if the Tornetta Decision Event occurs after vesting, Mr. Musk will\\nreturn or otherwise repay the Company for shares issued under the 2025 CEO Interim Award equal to the Excess Amount and the Company will return or otherwise repay the Purchase Price. Alternatively, rather than returning or repaying as contemplated in clause (ii), Mr. Musk may elect to forfeit the number of\\noptions underlying the 2018 CEO Award equal to the Excess Amount.\\n \\n¬∑Limited Pledging: Solely in order to satisfy payment of the Purchase Price and taxes due in respect of the vesting of the 2025 CEO Interim Award, Mr. Musk may pledge any shares he beneficially owns (including, without limitation, the 2025 CEO Interim Award and the 2018 CEO Award).\\n \\n¬∑Additional Vesting Provisions: The 2025 CEO Interim Award will vest on an accelerated basis prior to the second anniversary of the Date of Grant if Mr. Musk is in continued Eligible Service upon a Change in Control (as defined in the 2019 Plan) or his death.\\n \\nThe foregoing summary of the terms of the 2025 CEO Interim Award does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to both the 2019 Plan, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 10.8 to the Company‚Äôs Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the\\n‚ÄúSEC‚Äù) on January 31, 2025, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to the Company‚Äôs Annual Report on Form 10-K/A filed with the SEC on April 30, 2025, and the restricted stock award agreement pursuant to which the 2025 CEO Interim Award was granted (the ‚ÄúAward Agreement‚Äù), a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto,\\neach of which is incorporated by reference herein.\\n \\nAccounting Consequences of the 2025 CEO Interim Award\\n \\nThe Company expects to account for the 2025 CEO Interim Award as a grant of restricted stock with a performance condition in accordance with ASC Topic 718, which for purposes of the 2025 CEO Interim Award is based upon the probability of certain conditions being met. Restricted stock with a performance condition\\nis accounted for by recognizing compensation expense over the requisite service period, based on the accounting grant-date fair value, but only if and when the vesting of the award becomes probable. For accounting purposes, the accounting grant-date fair value of the 2025 CEO Interim Award will be determined on the date that the\\nshares of restricted stock are delivered to Mr. Musk, which will be subject to the termination or expiration of the waiting period or periods under the HSR Act as described above. The accounting grant-date fair value is expected to be based upon the prevailing market price of the Company‚Äôs common stock on such date less the\\nPurchase Price, adjusted to take into account an illiquidity discount due to the required holding period. The expense is adjusted for changes to the estimated likelihood of vesting based on the performance condition.\\n \\nAs of the date of this report, the Company expects that the performance condition of the 2025 CEO Interim Award will not be deemed to be probable of being met. As a result, the Company currently expects that it will not recognize a compensation expense upon the issuance of the award. However, the Company will\\nreassess the probability of the performance condition being met at least quarterly. If the Company determines that it is probable that the performance condition will be met, at that date, the Company will record a cumulative catch-up expense based on the accounting grant-date fair value of the award (which reflects an illiquidity\\ndiscount due to transfer and holding restrictions), ratably for the amount of time that has passed since the beginning of the two-year requisite service period and amounting to the remaining portion of the accounting grant-date fair value over the two-year requisite service period. If the performance condition remains not probable as\\nof the end of the two-year requisite service period, such that the 2025 CEO Interim Award remains subject to forfeiture or cancellation, the Company may not recognize the compensation expense at such time. If, at any time following the two-year vesting period, the performance condition becomes probable, the Company will be\\nrequired to recognize the related compensation expense at that time.\\n \\nThe Company is unable to predict whether a compensation expense will be recognized at any time during the two-year requisite service period, or thereafter.\\n \\nFor illustrative purposes only, if the approvals had been obtained on August 1, 2025, based on the closing stock price on such date, the accounting grant-date fair value of the 2025 CEO Interim Award would have been approximately $23.7 billion.  This amount is based on such assumptions and is provided only for\\nillustrative purposes. It does not reflect the accounting grant-date fair value of the 2025 CEO Interim Award that will be calculated in the future and disclosed in the Company‚Äôs future financial statements, nor is it indicative of the timing of recognizing any compensation expenses.\\n \\n-2-\\n \\n  \\nItem 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.\\n  \\nThe Company made a post on X containing a letter to shareholders from Robyn Denholm, Chair of Tesla's Board of Directors, and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, a Director of Tesla‚Äôs Board, the members of the Special Committee, announcing the grant of the 2025 CEO Interim Award on August 4, 2025.

       " {'text': '\\n--- Page 1 ---\\nThe Anti-Handbook Handbook\\nWe‚Äôre Tesla. We‚Äôre changing the world. We‚Äôre willing to rethink everything.\\nWe‚Äôre a high tech company unlike any other high tech company. We‚Äôre a car company unlike any other \\ncar company.\\nWe‚Äôre different and we like it that way. Being different allows us to do what no one else is doing; to do \\nwhat others tell us is impossible.\\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a traditional employee handbook filled with policies and rules, you won‚Äôt find one. \\nPolicies and rules tell you where the bottom is - they tell you how poorly you can perform before you get \\nshown the door. That‚Äôs not us.\\nWe prefer to have incredibly high standards and to hire exceptional people who enjoy pushing \\nthemselves to perform at the highest levels every day. We want to surround ourselves with people driven \\nto do the right things and act with integrity even when no one is looking.\\nIs this you? If so, we‚Äôre glad you‚Äôre here and we look forward to doing amazing things together . If this isn‚Äôt \\nyou, you‚Äôll be more successful somewhere else. We don‚Äôt mean to sound harsh; it‚Äôs just the truth.\\nSome of Our High Standards\\nIf you‚Äôre reading this, you‚Äôre probably new to Tesla and have questions about how some basic things play \\nout around here. Here‚Äôs what we think you need to know to get started. As for everything else, such as \\ninformation about our pay policies, meal and rest breaks, time of f, and leave policies, check the internal \\nwebsite at                 or ask.\\nTrust\\nWe give everyone who joins our team a lot of trust and responsibility, We operate with the assumption \\nthat everyone will do the right thing, including you. The truth is some people have violated this trust or \\nignored their responsibilities. We won‚Äôt change our approach because of the few who have let us down. \\nInstead, we let them go.\\nCommunication\\nAnyone at Tesla can and should email or talk to anyone else according to what they think is the fastest \\nway to solve a problem for the benefit of the whole company. You can talk with your manager, you can \\ntalk to your manager‚Äôs manager, you can talk directly to a VP in another department, you can talk to Elon \\n‚Äì you can talk to anyone without anyone else‚Äôs permission. Moreover, you should consider yourself \\nobligated to do so until the right thing happens.\\n\\n--- Page 2 ---\\nJob Duties\\nIt‚Äôs your responsibility to understand what‚Äôs expected of you. Your manager should explain your \\nresponsibilities and what‚Äôs expected; however, if you are unclear at any time, ask. ‚ÄúNo one told me‚Äù is an \\nexcuse that will never fly here.\\nYour #1 job - everyone‚Äôs #1 job - is making this company a success. If you see opportunities to improve \\nthe way we do things, speak up even if these are outside your area of responsibility . You have a personal \\nstake in Tesla‚Äôs success so make suggestions and share your ideas. Your good ideas mean nothing if  \\nyou keep them to yourself.\\nGoals and Feedback\\nYou and your supervisor are encouraged to discuss your job performance and goals on an informal, day-\\nto-day basis. If you would like feedback or any other input from your supervisor , take initiative and ask. \\nDo not wait for your supervisor to initiate a conversation or for a company-initiated review process to get \\nthe feedback you need to perform at a high level.\\nSafety\\nSafety is really important to us. We want you to go home every day in the same condition you arrived.\\nWe believe the best way to create a safety culture is to ask the really smart people working here to use \\ngood judgment and common sense. This means:\\n‚Ä¢ Being safety conscious at all times.\\n‚Ä¢ Complying with all safety policies and procedures, including wearing required protective \\nequipment. (Trust us, if we‚Äôve created a policy or rule, it‚Äôs only because it was absolutely needed. \\nWe don‚Äôt have arbitrary rules.)\\n‚Ä¢ Never performing a job that you feel is unsafe.\\n‚Ä¢ Keeping work areas clean and walkways free of obstructions, especially in production areas.\\n‚Ä¢ Communicating with others if you see safety issues.\\n‚Ä¢ Reporting unsafe or hazardous conditions to the Environmental Health & Safety Department.\\nAttendance\\nIf you‚Äôre the kind of person who holds yourself to the highest standards, our ‚Äúattendance policy‚Äù is exactly \\nwhat you‚Äôd expect it to be: Be the kind of person your team can rely on. Be here when you‚Äôre supposed to \\nbe here. We need you. We can‚Äôt get things done when you aren‚Äôt here.\\nIf you can‚Äôt be here, notify your supervisor as soon as possible and talk about what‚Äô s going on. Your \\nsupervisor will be reasonable and respectful if you are.\\nIf you can‚Äôt be reliable, this isn‚Äôt the place for you. You‚Äôll be asked to leave (and it might not be a choice)\\nTardiness\\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre tardy‚Äù is something kids are told in school. This isn‚Äôt school. Plan to be here on time, ready to start \\nwork when you‚Äôre scheduled. Traffic accidents happen, we get that but they don‚Äôt happen every Monday \\nduring football season.\\n--- Page 3 ---\\nSick Days\\nIf you‚Äôre sick, stay home. Don‚Äôt get the rest of us sick. Contact your supervisor by any means possible as \\nsoon as you can, ideally before you‚Äôre scheduled start time. If you‚Äôve accrued Paid Time Off (PTO) use it \\nand you‚Äôll be paid for that day.\\nVacations\\nWe know you need time off so schedule it in advance, get your supervisor‚Äôs approval, and then take it. \\nUse your PTO - that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs there for.\\nKeep in mind that every vacation request can‚Äôt be accommodated. Others may have already requested \\nthe same days off or critical deadlines may create vacation blackout periods.\\nNo Call, No Show\\nOur assumption will be that if you don‚Äôt ca ll and don‚Äôt show up for work, you ‚Äòre a jerk. You better have \\na really good reason for not letting us know why you didn‚Äôt come in or you‚Äôre out of here. One time is \\nenough.\\nOutside Employment\\nYou may hold a job with another company as long as you perform your job here well and you aren‚Äôt \\ncompromising anything confidential or proprietary.\\nWe won‚Äôt cut you any slack because you have another job - you will be judged by the same standards as \\neveryone else. If your other job interferes with your performance, you may be asked to terminate that job \\nif you wish to remain with Tesla.\\nStupid Stuff\\nIf you do something stupid, depending on the circumstances you may be coached and given another \\nchance or you may be asked to leave. We can‚Äôt afford to waste our time dealing with stupid stuff when we \\nhave so many important things to get done.\\nIf you need them, here are some examples of stupid things people do:\\n‚Ä¢ Stealing or deliberately damaging company property.\\n‚Ä¢ Disclosing confidential information.\\n‚Ä¢ Harassing or bullying others.\\n‚Ä¢ Physically hurting someone or threatening violence.\\n‚Ä¢ Possessing illegal drugs.\\n‚Ä¢ Possessing explosives, weapons or firearms.\\nThe list could go on and on. If you think you‚Äôre the kind of person who might do something that could be \\non a list of stupid stuff, do us all a favor and leave now.\\n--- Page 4 ---\\nFun\\nMake sure you‚Äôre having fun at work - meet new friends, push yourself in new ways, try new things. If you \\naren‚Äôt having fun at some level, you‚Äôll be unhappy. We don‚Äôt want that. We want you to work hard, love \\nwhat you do, and have fun.\\nMoral of the Story\\nThe theme of the above standards is simple: just behave like the sort of person you want as your co-\\nworker. Treat everyone like you want to be treated. Tesla must be the kind of company where people look \\nforward to coming to work in the morning. Life is too short for anything else.\\nResolving Concerns\\nWe want to provide a positive working environment and treat people as the individuals they are.\\nIf you have a concern, please speak freely and openly with anyone you think can help evaluate and \\nresolve the issues. If you aren‚Äôt sure who to talk to, contact Human Resources. W e will always do our \\nbest to provide a healthy, fulfilling, productive, and amicable workplace.',\n",

Stockholders of record may access the proxy materials on the website listed above or request a printed set\\nof the proxy materials be sent to them by following the instructions in the Notice of Internet Availability. The Notice of Internet Availability also\\nexplains how you may request that we send future proxy materials to you by e-mail or in printed form by mail.

If you choose to attend the 2023 Annual Meeting virtually via the Internet, we encourage you to access the\\nmeeting prior to the start time leaving ample time for log-in.\\n \\nQ:Where is the 2023 Annual Meeting?\\n \\nA:The 2023 Annual Meeting will be held at Gigafactory Texas located at 1 Tesla Road, Austin, TX 78725 and virtually via the Internet at\\nwww.meetnow.global/TESLA2023. Stockholders who are selected in the random drawing may request directions to the 2023 Annual Meeting in\\nperson by calling (512) 516-8177 or by contacting our investor relations at ir@tesla.com.\\n \\nQ:Will I be able to view the 2023 Annual Meeting via the Internet?\\n \\nA:Yes.

A minority of our stockholders are stockholders of record. We have sent the Notice of Internet Availability directly to you if\\nyou are a stockholder of record. As a stockholder of record, you may grant your voting proxy directly to Tesla or to a third party or vote in person\\nat the 2023 Annual Meeting as described more fully below.\\nYou are the ‚Äúbeneficial owner‚Äù of any shares (which are considered to be held in ‚Äústreet name‚Äù) that are held on your behalf by a brokerage\\naccount or by a bank or another intermediary that is the stockholder of record for those shares. The vast majority of our stockholders are\\nbeneficial owners. If you are a beneficial owner, you did not receive a Notice of Internet Availability directly from Tesla, but your broker, bank or\\nother intermediary forwarded you a notice together with voting instructions for directing that organization how to vote your shares. You may also\\nattend the 2023 Annual Meeting in person (if you are eligible per our random drawing to attend in person), but because a beneficial\\nowner is not a stockholder of record, you may not vote in person at the 2023 Annual Meeting unless you obtain a ‚Äúlegal proxy‚Äù from the\\norganization that holds your shares, giving you the right to vote the shares at the 2023 Annual Meeting.\\n \\nQ:How can I vote my shares in person at the 2023 Annual Meeting?\\n \\nA:You may vote shares for which you are the stockholder of record in person at the 2023 Annual Meeting (if you are eligible per our random\\ndrawing to attend in person). You may vote shares for which you are the beneficial owner in person (if you are eligible per our random drawing to\\nattend in person) at the 2023 Annual Meeting only if you obtain a ‚Äúlegal proxy‚Äù from the broker, bank or other intermediary that holds your\\nshares, giving you the right to vote the shares. Even if you plan to attend the 2023 Annual Meeting, and are eligible per our random drawing, we\\nrecommend that you also direct the voting of your shares as described below in the question entitled ‚ÄúHow can I vote my shares without\\nattending the 2023 Annual Meeting?‚Äù so that your vote will be counted even if you later decide not to attend the 2023 Annual Meeting.\\n \\nQ:How can I vote my shares virtually at the 2023 Annual Meeting?\\n \\nA: In order to join, submit questions and vote virtually via the Internet at the 2023 Annual Meeting, you will need a 15-digit secure ‚Äúcontrol\\nnumber‚Äù unique to you, which you may obtain as follows.\\n \\n ‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ If you are a ‚Äústockholder of record‚Äù with shares registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust\\nCompany (a minority of Tesla stockholders), you can find the control number on the Notice of Internet Availability or paper proxy\\ncard that was sent to you.\\n \\n ‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, you may:\\n \\n ‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ Register in advance to obtain a control number. Please ask your broker, bank or other intermediary that holds your shares for a\\n‚Äúlegal proxy‚Äù for the 2023 Annual Meeting and submit a copy of it from your e-mail address with ‚ÄúLegal Proxy‚Äù in the subject\\nline to legalproxy@computershare.com or by mail to Computershare at Tesla, Inc.

If your request is received no later than 3:00 p.m. Central Time on May 11, 2023, you will receive a\\nconfirmation e-mail with your control number; or\\n \\n ‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ Use the control number received with your voting instruction form. Please note, however, that this option is intended to be\\nprovided as a convenience to beneficial owners only, and there is no guarantee this option will be available for every type of\\nbeneficial owner voting control number.

If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, please check the voting\\ninstructions in the notice provided by your broker, bank or other intermediary for Internet voting availability.\\nBy telephone‚ÄîStockholders of record who live in the United States (or its territories) or Canada may request a paper proxy card from Tesla by\\nfollowing the procedures in the Notice of Internet Availability, and submit proxies by following the applicable ‚ÄúPhone‚Äù instructions on the proxy\\ncard. If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, please check the voting instructions in the notice provided by your broker, bank\\nor other intermediary for telephone voting availability.\\nBy mail‚ÄîStockholders of record may request a paper proxy card from Tesla by following the procedures in the Notice of Internet Availability. If\\nyou elect to vote by mail, please complete, sign and date the proxy card where indicated and return it in the prepaid envelope included with the\\nproxy card. Proxy cards submitted by mail must be received by the time of the meeting in order for your shares to be voted. If you are a beneficial\\nowner of shares held in street name, you may vote by mail by completing, signing and dating the voting instructions in the notice provided by\\nyour broker, bank or other intermediary and mailing it in the accompanying pre-addressed envelope.\\n \\nQ:How many shares must be present or represented to conduct business at the 2023 Annual Meeting?\\n \\nA:The stockholders of record of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the 2023 Annual Meeting must either (1) be present in person or virtually\\nvia the Internet at the 2023 Annual Meeting or (2) have properly submitted a proxy in order to constitute a quorum at the 2023 Annual Meeting.\\nUnder the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, abstentions and broker ‚Äúnon-votes‚Äù are counted as present, and therefore are\\nincluded for the purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the 2023 Annual Meeting. A broker ‚Äúnon-vote‚Äù occurs when an\\norganization that is the stockholder of record that holds shares for a beneficial owner, and which is otherwise counted as present or represented by\\nproxy, does not vote on a particular proposal because that organization does not have discretionary voting power under applicable regulations to\\nvote on that item and has not received specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner.\\n \\nQ:What proposals will be voted on at the 2023 Annual Meeting?\\n \\nA:The proposals scheduled to be voted on at the 2023 Annual Meeting are:\\nTesla Proposals\\n \\n ‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ A Tesla proposal to elect three Class I directors listed in this proxy statement to serve for a term of three years, or until their respective\\nsuccessors are duly elected and qualified (Proposal One);\\n \\n ‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ A Tesla proposal to approve executive compensation on a non-binding advisory basis (Proposal Two);\\n \\n ‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ A Tesla proposal to approve the frequency of future votes on executive compensation on a non-binding advisory basis (Proposal\\nThree);\\n \\n ‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ A Tesla proposal to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Tesla‚Äôs independent registered public accounting firm\\nfor the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023 (Proposal Four); and\\nStockholder Proposals\\n \\n ‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ A stockholder proposal regarding reporting on key-person risk, if properly presented (Proposal Five).\\n \\n4    Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement   \\nTable of Contents\\nQ:What is the voting requirement to approve each of the proposals?\\n \\nA:\\n \\nProposal   Vote Required     Broker\\nDiscretionary\\nVoting Allowed\\nProposal One‚ÄîTesla proposal to elect three\\nClass I directors\\n  Majority of the shares present in person or\\nrepresented by proxy and entitled to vote on the\\nelection of directors     No\\nProposal Two‚ÄîTesla proposal to approve\\nexecutive compensation on a non-binding\\nadvisory basis   Majority of the shares present in person or\\nrepresented by proxy and entitled to vote on the\\nsubject matter     No\\nProposal Three‚ÄîTesla proposal to approve the\\nfrequency of future votes on executive\\ncompensation on a non-binding advisory basis  The frequency (every one, two or three years)\\nreceiving the most votes will be considered the\\nfrequency recommended by stockholders     No\\nProposal Four‚ÄîTesla proposal to ratify the\\nappointment of independent registered public\\naccounting firm   Majority of the shares present in person or\\nrepresented by proxy and entitled to vote on the\\nsubject matter     Yes\\nProposal Five‚ÄîStockholder proposal regarding\\nreporting on key-person risk, if properly\\npresented   Majority of the shares present in person or\\nrepresented by proxy and entitled to vote on the\\nsubject matter     No\\n \\nQ:How are votes counted?\\n \\nA:All shares entitled to vote and that are voted in person at the 2023 Annual Meeting will be counted, and all shares represented by properly\\nexecuted and unrevoked proxies received prior to the 2023 Annual Meeting will be voted at the 2023 Annual Meeting as indicated in such proxies.\\nYou may vote ‚ÄúFOR,‚Äù ‚ÄúAGAINST‚Äù or ‚ÄúABSTAIN‚Äù on each of the nominees for election as director (Proposal One), and on each of Proposals\\nTwo, Four and Five. You may vote to recommend, by non-binding vote, the frequency of future executive compensation votes (Proposal Three)\\nfor a vote every one, two or three years, or you may abstain from voting.\\nWith respect to the election of directors, Tesla‚Äôs bylaws provide that in an uncontested election, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares\\npresent in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the matter is required to elect a director. Abstentions with respect\\nto any director nominee (Proposal One) or any of Proposals Two, Four and Five will have the same effect as a vote against such nominee or\\nProposal. Consequently, each director nominee will be elected, and each of Proposals Two, Four and Five will be approved or ratified, as\\napplicable, only if the number of shares voted ‚ÄúFOR‚Äù such nominee or Proposal exceeds the total number of shares voted ‚ÄúAGAINST‚Äù or to\\n‚ÄúABSTAIN‚Äù with respect to such nominee or Proposal.\\nYou may vote to recommend, by non-binding vote, the frequency of future executive compensation votes (Proposal Three) for a vote every one,\\ntwo or three years, or you may abstain from voting. The Board will consider the frequency option that receives the greatest number of votes\\namong the three frequency options to be the recommendation of the stockholders. Abstentions will have no effect on Proposal Three.\\n \\nQ:What is the effect of not casting a vote or if I submit a proxy but do not specify how my shares are to be voted?\\n \\nA:If you are a stockholder of record and you do not vote by proxy card, by telephone or via the Internet before the 2023 Annual Meeting, or in\\nperson or virtually via the Internet at the 2023 Annual Meeting, your shares will not be voted at the 2023 Annual Meeting. If you submit a proxy,\\nbut you do not provide voting instructions, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of the Board (or, if there is no\\nrecommendation of the Board on a Proposal, your shares will not be voted on such Proposal).\\n \\n  Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement    5\\nTable of Contents\\n \\nIf you are a beneficial owner and you do not provide the organization that is the stockholder of record for your shares with voting instructions, the\\norganization will determine if it has the discretionary authority to vote on the particular matter. Under applicable regulations, brokers and other\\nintermediaries have the discretion to vote on routine matters, such as Proposal Four, but do not have discretion to vote on non-routine matters such\\nas Proposals One, Two, Three and Five. Therefore, if you do not provide voting instructions to that organization, it may vote your shares only on\\nProposal Four and any other routine matters properly presented for a vote at the 2023 Annual Meeting.\\n \\nQ:What is the effect of a broker ‚Äúnon-vote‚Äù?\\n \\nA:An organization that holds shares of Tesla‚Äôs common stock for a beneficial owner will have the discretion to vote on routine proposals if it has not\\nreceived voting instructions from the beneficial owner at least ten days prior to the 2023 Annual Meeting. A broker ‚Äúnon-vote‚Äù occurs when a\\nbroker, bank or other intermediary that is otherwise counted as present or represented by proxy does not receive voting instructions from the\\nbeneficial owner and does not have the discretion to vote the shares. A broker ‚Äúnon-vote‚Äù will be counted for purposes of calculating whether a\\nquorum is present at the 2023 Annual Meeting, but will not be counted for purposes of determining the number of votes present in person or\\nrepresented by proxy and entitled to vote with respect to a particular proposal as to which that broker ‚Äúnon-vote‚Äù occurs. Thus, a broker\\n‚Äúnon-vote‚Äù will not impact our ability to obtain a quorum for the 2023 Annual Meeting and will not otherwise affect the approval by a majority of\\nthe votes present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote of any of the Proposals One, Two, Three and Five. As described above,\\nbroker non-votes are not expected to occur in connection with Proposal Four.\\n \\nQ:How does the Board recommend that I vote?\\n \\nA:The Board recommends that you vote your shares:\\n \\n ‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ ‚ÄúFOR‚Äù the three nominees for election as Class I directors (Proposal One);\\n \\n ‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ ‚ÄúFOR‚Äù the approval, by non-binding advisory vote, of executive compensation (Proposal Two);\\n \\n ‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ ‚ÄúEVERY THREE YEARS‚Äù for the approval, by non-binding advisory vote, of a triennial executive compensation vote (Proposal\\nThree);\\n \\n ‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ ‚ÄúFOR‚Äù the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Tesla‚Äôs independent registered public accounting firm\\nfor the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023 (Proposal Four); and\\n \\n ‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ ‚ÄúAGAINST‚Äù the approval of the stockholder proposal regarding reporting on key-person risk (Proposal Five).\\n \\nQ:What happens if additional matters are presented at the 2023 Annual Meeting?\\n \\nA:If any other matters are properly presented for consideration at the 2023 Annual Meeting, including, among other things, consideration of a motion\\nto adjourn the 2023 Annual Meeting to another time or place, the persons named as proxy holders, Elon Musk and Zachary Kirkhorn, or either of\\nthem, will have discretion to vote the proxies held by them on those matters in accordance with their best judgment. Tesla has received notice\\nfrom a stockholder of an intent to propose a resolution at the 2023 Annual Meeting requesting reporting on plans to eradicate child labor and\\nforced labor from its supply chain. Other than the floor proposal, Tesla does not currently anticipate that any other matters will be raised at the\\n2023 Annual Meeting.\\n \\nQ:Can I change my vote?\\n \\nA:If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote (1) by submitting a new proxy bearing a later date (which automatically revokes the\\nearlier proxy) using any of the voting methods described above in the question entitled ‚ÄúHow can I vote my shares without attending the 2023\\nAnnual Meeting?,‚Äù (2) by providing a written notice of revocation to Tesla, Inc., 1 Tesla Road, Austin, Texas 78725, Attention: Legal\\nDepartment, with a copy sent by e-mail to shareholdermail@tesla.com, prior to your shares being voted, or (3) by attending the 2023 Annual\\nMeeting and voting in person or virtually via the Internet, which will supersede any proxy previously submitted by you. However, merely\\nattending the meeting will not cause your previously granted proxy to be revoked unless you specifically request it.\\nIf you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, you may generally change your vote by (1) submitting new voting instructions to your\\nbroker, bank or other intermediary or (2) if you have obtained a ‚Äúlegal proxy‚Äù from the organization that holds your shares giving you the right to\\nvote your shares, by attending the 2023 Annual Meeting and voting in person. However, please consult that organization for any specific rules it\\nmay have regarding your ability to change your voting instructions.\\n \\n6    Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement   \\nTable of Contents\\nQ:What should I do if I receive more than one Notice of Internet Availability, notice from my broker, bank or other intermediary, or set of\\nproxy materials?\\n \\nA:You may receive more than one Notice of Internet Availability, notice from your broker, bank or other intermediary, or set of proxy materials,\\nincluding multiple copies of proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you are a beneficial owner with shares in more than one\\nbrokerage account, you may receive a separate notice or voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a\\nstockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one Notice of Internet Availability or\\nproxy card. Please complete, sign, date and return each Tesla proxy card or voting instruction card that you receive, and/or follow the voting\\ninstructions on each Notice of Internet Availability or other notice you receive, to ensure that all your shares are voted.\\n \\nQ:Is my vote confidential?\\n \\nA:Proxy instructions, ballots and voting tabulations that identify individual stockholders are handled in a manner that protects your voting privacy.\\nYour vote will not be disclosed either within Tesla or to third parties, except: (1) as necessary for applicable legal requirements, (2) to allow for the\\ntabulation and certification of the votes and (3) to facilitate a successful proxy solicitation. Occasionally, stockholders provide written comments\\non their proxy cards, which may be forwarded to Tesla management.\\n \\nQ:Who will serve as inspector of election?\\n \\nA:The inspector of election will be Computershare Trust Company, N.A.\\n \\nQ:Where can I find the voting results of the 2023 Annual Meeting?\\n \\nA:We will publish final voting results in our Current Report on Form 8-K, which will be filed with the SEC and made available on its website at\\nwww.sec.gov within four (4) business days of the 2023 Annual Meeting.\\n \\nQ:Who will bear the cost of soliciting votes for the 2023 Annual Meeting?\\n \\nA:Tesla will pay the entire cost of preparing, assembling, printing, mailing and distributing these proxy materials and soliciting votes. We may\\nreimburse brokerage firms, custodians, nominees, fiduciaries and other persons representing beneficial owners for their reasonable expenses in\\nforwarding solicitation material to those beneficial owners. Our directors, officers and employees may also solicit proxies in person or by other\\nmeans. These directors, officers and employees will not be additionally compensated but may be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket\\nexpenses incurred in doing so.\\n \\nQ:What is the deadline to propose actions for consideration at next year‚Äôs annual meeting of stockholders or to nominate individuals to\\nserve as directors?\\n \\nA:You may submit proposals, including recommendations of director candidates, for consideration at future stockholder meetings.\\nFor inclusion in Tesla‚Äôs proxy materials‚ÄîStockholders may present proper proposals for inclusion in Tesla‚Äôs proxy statement and for\\nconsideration at the next annual meeting of stockholders by submitting their proposals in writing in a timely manner to:\\nTesla, Inc.\\n1 Tesla Road\\nAustin, Texas 78725\\nAttention: Legal Department\\nwith a copy sent by e-mail to shareholdermail@tesla.com.\\nAny correspondence that is not addressed precisely in accordance with the foregoing, including any correspondence directed to a specific\\nindividual, may not be received timely or at all, and we strongly recommend that you also send such correspondence by e-mail and verify\\nthat you receive a confirmation of receipt from Tesla.\\nIn order to be included in the proxy statement for the 2024 annual meeting of stockholders, stockholder proposals must be received in accordance\\nwith the above instructions no later than December 8, 2023, provided that if the date of the\\n \\n  Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement    7\\nTable of Contents\\n \\n2024 annual meeting of stockholders is more than 30 days from the one-year anniversary of the 2023 Annual Meeting, the deadline will instead be\\na reasonable time before we begin to print and send our proxy materials for the 2024 annual meeting of stockholders. In addition, stockholder\\nproposals must otherwise comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ‚ÄúExchange Act‚Äù).\\nOur bylaws also provide for a right of proxy access.

Our corporate governance structure has facilitated several key decisions which\\nhave set Tesla up to achieve long-term success and our mission to accelerate the world‚Äôs transition to sustainable energy.\\n \\nSome examples include our decisions to:\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ Manufacture all-electric vehicles from the ground up rather than being a mere supplier of EV components;\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ Establish an international network of our stores, service centers and Supercharger stations despite regulatory hurdles and the significant\\ncapital outlay required to do so;\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ Build Gigafactory Nevada, the largest lithium-ion battery factory in the world, so that we can scale most effectively;\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ Expand into energy generation and storage through the acquisition of SolarCity Corporation in 2016 to create a vertically integrated\\nsustainable energy company and empower individual consumers to be their own utility;\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ Deploy FSD Beta incrementally, resulting in over 130 million cumulative miles driven with FSD Beta to date; and\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ Compensate our CEO only if other stockholders realize tremendous value.\\nThese and other similar decisions were made due to our corporate governance structure and, ultimately, decisions like these are what differentiate Tesla\\nfrom other companies.\\nYear-Round Engagement\\nOur Board continuously evaluates our corporate governance structure, practices and policies, and weighs stakeholder feedback. The Board maintains an\\nactive, year-round dialogue with our largest stockholders to ensure that Tesla‚Äôs Board and management understand and consider the issues that matter\\nmost to our stockholders. This includes focused one-on-one meetings between our Board and stockholders throughout the year that are designed to give\\ninstitutional stockholders an opportunity to better understand our strategy and governance and raise any concerns, and allow our directors to become\\nbetter informed about our stockholders‚Äô views and concerns.\\nBoard Responsiveness\\nThrough the Board‚Äôs engagement program discussed above, we have received, and continue to periodically receive, helpful input regarding a number of\\nstockholder-related matters. Moreover, members of the Board and management from time to time seek input from our investors when considering\\nimportant corporate actions, including our consideration of, and responses to, stockholder proposals that involve corporate governance and alignment\\nwith stockholder interests. As a result, we have adopted a number of significant changes, including but not limited to:\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ Progressively adding directors who are independent under the requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (‚ÄúNasdaq‚Äù) and bring\\nadditional viewpoints and key skills in different areas as we evolve, including Kathleen Wilson- Thompson in 2018, Hiromichi Mizuno in\\n2020, Joe Gebbia in 2022 and JB Straubel as a nominee this year;\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ Following the passing proposal at the 2022 Annual Meeting relating to proxy access, meeting with key stockholders to discuss their views and\\nformulate a framework to address the proposal, after which the Board voted to amend the bylaws of the Company to enable proxy access, in\\nsuch a manner as to reflect such stockholder views;\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ Hosting Investor Day in March 2023, in which Tesla leaders presented on key areas important to our success, affording stockholders more\\ndetailed assessments of the performance, achievements, growth opportunities and areas of focus for our businesses, and addressing\\nstockholder feedback requesting greater visibility into our business leaders and roadmap;\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ Amending our pledging policy to (i) cap the aggregate loan or investment amount that can be collateralized by the pledged stock of our CEO\\nto the lesser of $3.5 billion or twenty-five percent (25%) of the total value of the pledged stock, and (ii) lower the percentage used to calculate\\nthe maximum loan or investment amount borrowable by directors and officers (other than our CEO) based on the total value of such director\\nor officer‚Äôs pledged stock from 25% to 15%;\\n \\n  Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement    9\\nTable of Contents\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ Enhancing our proxy statement disclosures, including with respect to our corporate governance approach, succession planning, risk oversight,\\nCommittee engagement and director skills;\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ Publishing an annual Impact Report, and providing disclosures including those aligned with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial\\nDisclosures (TCFD) and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board recommendations, as well as EEO-1 data; and\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ Recommending management proposals in prior years, including at the 2022 Annual Meeting, to reduce director terms and eliminate\\napplicable supermajority voting requirements.\\nThis year, we will be publishing our fifth annual Impact Report with enhanced disclosures across people, environment, product and supply chain. In\\nresponse to stockholder engagement, we are disclosing additional Scope 3 emissions categories and aligning with the TCFD‚Äôs recommended climate-\\nrelated disclosures. We will also expand disclosures on the culture we continue to build and enhance at Tesla, how we engage and aim to retain our\\nemployees, progress we are making on displacing fossil fuels, the efficiency and safety of our products and how we manage risks in the supply chain,\\namong many other topics. For further information, please navigate to the ‚ÄúImpact‚Äù page of the Investor Relations section on our website. We intend to\\npublish our 2022 Report by the end of April 2023. Information contained on, or accessible through, our website and in our Impact Report, is not\\nincorporated in, and is not part of, this proxy statement or any other report or filing we make with the SEC.\\nOur Board‚Äôs Commitment to Governance\\n \\n \\nOur Board believes in maintaining stockholder confidence through, among other things, demonstrating its responsiveness to stockholder feedback\\nand its commitment to corporate governance. Accordingly, to provide an enhanced voice to our stockholders in approving fundamental corporate\\nmatters, the Board is committed to enabling the elimination of certain supermajority voting requirements in our charter and bylaws through the\\nprocess outlined below.\\n \\nIn each of the last four years, our Board repeatedly proposed amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws to reduce director terms and/or\\nto eliminate certain supermajority voting. However, such amendments failed to pass each time that the Board proposed them. Because the affirmative\\nvote of at least 66 2/3% of the total outstanding shares entitled to vote is required to approve such amendments, similar proposals cannot pass unless we\\nachieve such a stockholder participation rate.\\nIn response to not reaching the required stockholder participation rate, during 2022, we took active steps in an effort to increase the participation rate of\\nour retail investors through the development of our Shareholder Platform (discussed below), outreach campaigns, direct mailings, one-on-one\\nengagements and through social media channels. This resulted in achieving our highest stockholder participation rate in the last five years in 2022 of\\nover 63%, though still short of the required 66 2/3% participation rate.\\nThis year, we will again marshal our resources and continue our efforts to further increase retail investor participation rates as rapidly as possible, via\\nevents such as our 2023 Investor Day, and with an active communications campaign via our new Shareholder Platform and social media channels\\nencouraging retail stockholders to vote their shares.\\nOnce we have achieved a total stockholder participation rate of at least 65% at a stockholder meeting, the Board will again propose charter and bylaw\\namendments to eliminate supermajority voting requirements. To the extent that this proposal to eliminate supermajority voting requirements achieves the\\nrequired threshold to pass, this will unlock a gateway for our Board and stockholders to adopt further stockholder-driven governance actions, including,\\nwithout limitation, the right for stockholders to act by written consent or to call a special meeting, and the declassification of the Board. Furthermore, as\\npreviously discussed, the Board is consistently listening and receptive to taking further governance actions when appropriate.\\nShareholder Platform\\nIn 2022, building on our efforts to enhance engagement among our retail stockholder base, Tesla launched our Shareholder Platform. Any Tesla\\nstockholder, regardless of holdings size, can sign up to stay informed about investor-related topics such as quarterly filings and event announcements,\\nand are eligible for selection to participate in in-person access to Tesla events such as the Tesla Semi launch event, AI Day 2, Investor Day and our\\nannual meetings. Tesla has one of the largest retail stockholder bases of any public company. Our retail stockholders are incredibly engaged and tend to\\nhave a very strong understanding of the Company, and are an important base of support and feedback for management and the Board. We will continue\\nto build the system to maximize depth of engagement and reach. Our goal is for every stockholder who wants to engage with the Company to have a\\nmeaningful framework for interaction through the Shareholder Platform.\\n \\n10    Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement   \\nTable of Contents\\nHybrid Annual Stockholder Meetings\\nBeginning in 2020, we have conducted our annual meetings both in-person and online through a live webcast and online stockholder tools. Our online\\nformat opens up engagement to all stockholders, regardless of the amount of stock owned and geography, and allows our substantial retail stockholder\\npopulation to hear directly from our Board and management, as well as to submit questions online. At the same time, due to investor feedback and\\ninterest, we continue to also host our meetings in-person so stockholders have the opportunity to engage with our Board and management in-person.\\n \\n  Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement    11\\nTable of Contents\\n \\nMANAGEMENT  PROPOSALS\\nPROPOSAL  ONE\\nTESLA  PROPOSAL  FOR ELECTION  OF DIRECT ORS\\nGeneral\\nTesla‚Äôs Board currently consists of eight members who are divided into three classes with staggered three-year terms. Our bylaws permit the Board to\\nestablish by resolution the authorized number of directors, and eight directors are currently authorized. Any increase or decrease in the number of\\ndirectors will be distributed among the three classes so that, as nearly as possible, each class will consist of an equal number of directors. The Board and\\nthe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will continue to frequently evaluate the optimal size and composition of the Board to allow it to\\noperate nimbly and efficiently, while maintaining new ideas, expertise and experience among its membership.\\nHiromichi Mizuno, a Class I director, will not stand for re-election to the Board when his current term ends at the 2023 Annual Meeting. Accordingly,\\nthe Board has nominated JB Straubel to succeed Mr. Mizuno as a Class I director. Mr. Straubel joined Tesla in 2004, and spent 14 years as our Chief\\nTechnology Officer, where he played a key role in our battery cell design, and engineering and production. Mr. Straubel also led the construction and\\nconcept of Gigafactory Nevada and the production ramp of our Model 3. After his departure from Tesla in 2019, Mr. Straubel founded Redwood\\nMaterials Inc. (‚ÄúRedwood‚Äù), which is dedicated to building a circular supply chain to power a sustainable world and accelerate the reduction of fossil\\nfuels. We believe that Mr. Straubel‚Äôs extensive operational experience in senior leadership at the Company, combined with his engineering expertise and\\npassion for cleantech, will make him an important asset in our mission to accelerate the world‚Äôs transition to sustainable energy.\\nNominees for Class I Directors\\nThree candidates have been nominated for election as Class I directors at the 2023 Annual Meeting for a three-year term expiring in 2026.\\nUpon recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board has nominated Elon Musk, Robyn Denholm and JB\\nStraubel for election as Class I directors. Biographical information about each of the nominees is contained in the following section. A discussion of the\\nqualifications, attributes and skills of each nominee that led the Board and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to the conclusion that\\nhe or she should be elected or continue to serve as a director follows each of the director and nominee biographies.\\nIf you are a stockholder of record and you sign your proxy card or vote by telephone or over the Internet but do not give instructions with respect to the\\nvoting of directors, your shares will be voted ‚ÄúFOR‚Äù the election of Messrs. Musk and Straubel and Ms. Denholm. Each of Messrs. Musk and Straubel\\nand Ms. Denholm has accepted such nomination; however, in the event that a nominee is unable or declines to serve as a director at the time of the 2023\\nAnnual Meeting, the proxies will be voted for any nominee who shall be designated by the Board to fill such vacancy. If you wish to give specific\\ninstructions with respect to the voting of directors, you may do so by indicating your instructions on your proxy card or when you vote by telephone or\\nover the Internet. If you are a beneficial owner holding your shares in street name and you do not give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other\\nintermediary, that organization will leave your shares unvoted on this matter.\\n \\nTHE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR  THE TESLA  PROPOSAL  FOR THE ELECTION OF\\nELON MUSK, ROBYN DENHOLM AND JB STRAUBEL.\\n \\n12    Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement   \\nTable of Contents\\nInformation Regarding the Board and Director Nominees\\nThe names of the members of the Board and Tesla‚Äôs director nominees, their respective ages, their positions with Tesla and other biographical\\ninformation as of April 6, 2023, are set forth below.

This proposal, commonly known as a ‚Äúsay-on-pay‚Äù proposal, gives our stockholders the opportunity to weigh in on our named\\nexecutive officers‚Äô compensation as a whole. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation or any specific named executive\\nofficer, but rather the overall compensation of all of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy\\nstatement. We currently have a policy providing for a triennial say-on-pay vote and, in Proposal Three (advisory vote on the frequency of future\\nexecutive compensation advisory approvals), the Board recommends that stockholders approve an advisory resolution supporting continued triennial\\nsay-on-pay votes. Accordingly, we anticipate that the next advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers would occur in 2026.\\nThe say-on-pay vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee or the Board. The say-on-pay vote will,\\nhowever, provide information to us regarding investor sentiment about our executive compensation philosophy, policies and practices, which the\\nCompensation Committee will be able to consider when determining executive compensation for the remainder of the current fiscal year and beyond.\\nThe Board and the Compensation Committee value the opinions of our stockholders and to the extent there is any significant vote against our named\\nexecutive officer compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement, we will consider our stockholders‚Äô concerns and the Compensation Committee will\\nevaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns.\\nSummary of the 2022 Executive Compensation Program\\nThe following is a summary of some of the key points of our 2022 executive compensation program:\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ Tesla continues to emphasize structuring compensation incentives to reward our named executive officers based on performance.\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ Equity awards weigh heavily in our named executive officers‚Äô total compensation, including awards that vest upon the achievement of clear\\nand measurable milestones. Since these awards increase in value as our stock price increases (and in the case of stock option awards, have no\\nvalue unless our stock price increases following their grant), our named executive officers‚Äô incentives are closely aligned with the long-term\\ninterests of our stockholders. In 2020, the last year any of our named executive officers received equity awards, such awards were all granted\\nin the form of stock options. As a result, a significant portion of our named executive officers‚Äô total compensation is entirely at risk,\\ndepending on long-term stock price performance.\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ Tesla has no cash bonus program for any of our named executive officers and generally does not provide any perquisites or tax\\nreimbursements to our named executive officers that are not available to other employees. No named executive officer currently has any\\nseverance or change of control arrangement.\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ Each named executive officer is employed at will and is expected to demonstrate exceptional personal performance in order to continue\\nserving as a member of the executive team.\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, historically earned a base salary that reflected the applicable minimum wage requirements under\\nCalifornia law, and he was subject to income taxes based on such base salary. However, he has never accepted his salary. Commencing\\nin May 2019 at Mr. Musk‚Äôs request, we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary. Consequently, 100% of Mr. Musk‚Äôs\\nfuture compensation was at-risk in the form of the remaining unvested stock options under the 10-year performance-based stock option award\\ngranted to Elon Musk in January 2018 (the ‚Äú2018 CEO Performance Award‚Äù).\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ In particular, the 2018 CEO Performance Award consisted of 12 equal tranches, each which vested upon the achievement of a market\\ncapitalization milestone matched to one of eight revenue-based operational milestones or eight Adjusted EBITDA-based operational\\nmilestones, all of which were viewed as difficult hurdles at the time of grant. While our stockholders benefit from each incremental increase\\nin Tesla‚Äôs performance and stock price, aligning\\n \\n  Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement    23\\n--- Page 6 ---\\nTable of Contents\\n \\n their interests with Mr. Musk‚Äôs incentives, the tranches under the 2018 CEO Performance Award vested only upon the full achievement of\\nspecific milestones, making it even more challenging for Mr. Musk to realize value from such increases. As of the date of this proxy\\nstatement, all of the tranches have vested and become exercisable, subject to Mr. Musk‚Äôs payment of the exercise price of $23.34 per share, as\\nadjusted to give effect to the three-for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend in August 2022 (the ‚Äú2022 Stock Split‚Äù) and the\\nfive-for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend in August 2020 (the ‚Äú2020 Stock Split‚Äù), and the minimum five-year holding\\nperiod generally applicable to any shares he acquires upon exercise. See ‚ÄúExecutive Compensation‚ÄîCompensation Discussion and Analysis\\n‚ÄîChief Executive Officer Compensation‚Äù below for more details.\\nFor detailed information about Tesla‚Äôs executive compensation program, see the ‚ÄúExecutive Compensation‚Äù section beginning on page 40 below.\\nTesla believes that the information provided above and within the ‚ÄúExecutive Compensation‚Äù section of this proxy statement demonstrates that Tesla‚Äôs\\nexecutive compensation program was designed appropriately and is working to ensure management‚Äôs interests are aligned with our stockholders‚Äô\\ninterests to support long-term value creation.\\nProposed Resolution\\nAccordingly, we ask our stockholders to vote ‚ÄúFOR‚Äù the following resolution at the 2023 Annual Meeting:\\n‚ÄúRESOLVED, that the Company‚Äôs stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in the\\nCompany‚Äôs Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange\\nCommission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and the other related disclosure.‚Äù\\n \\nTHE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR  THE TESLA  PROPOSAL  FOR A NON-BINDING  ADVISOR Y\\nVOTE APPROVING EXECUTIVE COMPENSA TION.\\n \\n24    Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement   \\n--- Page 7 ---\\nTable of Contents\\nPROPOSAL  THREE\\nTESLA  PROPOSAL  FOR NON-BINDING  ADVISOR Y VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY  OF\\nTHE FUTURE  NON-BINDING  VOTE ON EXECUTIVE  COMPENSA TION\\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the ‚ÄúDodd-Frank Act‚Äù) enables our stockholders to indicate, at least once\\nevery six years, how frequently we should seek a non-binding vote on the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the\\nSEC‚Äôs compensation disclosure rules, such as Proposal Two beginning on page 23 of this proxy statement. By voting on this Proposal Three,\\nstockholders may indicate whether they would prefer a non-binding vote on named executive officer compensation once every one, two or three years.\\nAfter careful consideration, our Board has determined that a non-binding vote on executive compensation that occurs triennially is the most appropriate\\nalternative for the Company, and therefore our Board recommends that you vote for a three-year interval for the non-binding vote on executive\\ncompensation.\\nIn formulating its recommendation, our Board considered that given the nature of our compensation programs, a triennial vote would be sufficient for\\nour stockholders to provide us with their input on our compensation philosophy, policies and practices. For example, our Chief Executive Officer has not\\nreceived an equity award since 2018, and our other named executive officers have not received an equity award since 2020. A triennial approach also\\nprovides regular input by stockholders, while allowing time to evaluate the effects of our compensation program on performance over a longer period.\\nHowever, we understand that our stockholders may have different views as to what is the best approach for the Company, and we look forward to\\nhearing from our stockholders on this Proposal. The next advisory vote on the frequency of the non-binding vote on executive compensation is expected\\nto be held at the 2029 annual meeting.\\nYou may cast your vote on your preferred voting frequency by choosing the option of one year, two years, three years or abstain from voting when you\\nvote in response to the resolution set forth below:\\n‚ÄúRESOLVED, that the option of once every one year, two years or three years that receives the highest number of votes cast for this resolution will be\\ndetermined to be the preferred frequency with which the Company is to hold a stockholder vote to approve the compensation of the named executive\\nofficers, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion\\nand Analysis, the compensation tables and the other related disclosure.‚Äù\\nThe Board will consider the frequency option that receives the greatest number of votes among the three frequency options to be the recommendation of\\nthe stockholders. However, this vote is advisory and is not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee or our Board. The Board may decide\\nthat it is in the best interests of our stockholders and the Company to hold an advisory vote on executive compensation more or less frequently than the\\noption approved by our stockholders.\\n \\nTHE BOARD RECOMMENDS A TRIENNIAL  VOTE AS THE FREQUENCY  WITH WHICH ST OCKHOLDERS\\nARE PROVIDED AN ADVISOR Y VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSA TION.\\n \\n  Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement    25\\n--- Page 8 ---\\nTable of Contents\\n \\nPROPOSAL  FOUR\\nTESLA  PROPOSAL  FOR RATIFICA TION  OF APPOINTMENT  OF INDEPENDENT\\nREGISTERED  PUBLIC  ACCOUNTING  FIRM\\nGeneral\\nThe Audit Committee has selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Tesla‚Äôs independent registered public accounting firm to audit the consolidated\\nfinancial statements of Tesla for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, which will include an audit of the effectiveness of Tesla‚Äôs internal control\\nover financial reporting.

Sumtris\\nehf has informed us that it is the beneficial owner of more than 100 shares of Tesla‚Äôs common stock and intends to present the following proposal at the\\n2023 Annual Meeting. Sumtris ehf‚Äôs address is Vagnh√∂f√∞i 8, 110, Reykjavik, Iceland. The stockholder proposal will be required to be voted upon at the\\n2023 Annual Meeting only if properly presented.\\nStockholder Proposal and Supporting Statement\\n***\\nRESOLVED, Tesla, Inc. (‚ÄúTesla‚Äù or ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) shareholders ask the Board of Directors to oversee the preparation and maintenance of a publicly-\\ndisclosed report on Tesla‚Äôs Key-Person Risk, including identification of key persons and actions to ameliorate the impacts of their potential loss.\\nSupport: Tesla is frequently cited as a prominent example of a company that has so-called Key-Person Risk, due to the prominence of its CEO and the\\nlack of a clear public succession plan or strategy to ameliorate the impacts of his loss.\\nAccording to a 2018 Morgan Stanley report, in 2017 59 S&P 500 CEOs left their companies, and these companies then underperformed the market by\\n11% in the subsequent 12 months. Loss of a key person can be due to decisions from the key person to part with the company; the company to part with\\nthe key person; or outside factors (such as untimely death or disability)‚Äîand all of these are rarely easy to foresee long in advance.\\nThe standard procedure for dealing with Key-Person Risk is:\\n \\n 1. Identify key persons.\\n \\n 2. Document processes and procedures for their succession.\\n \\n 3. Spread knowledge / cross- train successors.\\n \\n 4. Manage communication with stakeholders\\n \\n 5. Financial mitigation of key-person loss impacts\\nAt present, Tesla shareholders can have little confidence that said risk has been at all ameliorated. Tesla specifically cites as a risk in its Q3 10-Q: ‚ÄúWe\\nare highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer‚Äù - offering no explanation of how it plans to\\ndeal with said risk. We ask the board to present to shareholders a clear and unambiguous Key-Person Risk amelioration strategy, documenting that all of\\nthe above five points have been met so that shareholders can be confident that the company will have qualified successors in mind who are prepared to\\nlead the company to success in the event of a key-person departure.\\n***\\nOpposing Statement of the Board\\nThe Board has considered this proposal and determined that it would be detrimental to the interests of Tesla and our stockholders.\\nContrary to the proponent‚Äôs claims, Tesla does recognize that recruiting and retaining a highly talented and experienced management team, not just the\\nCEO, is critical to Tesla‚Äôs success. The Board and the management of Tesla are best equipped to carry out succession planning, as well as to handle day-\\nto-day hiring, promotion and termination decisions. Such decisions take into consideration numerous criteria that are continually adapted to meet the\\nevolving demands of Tesla, as determined by the Board and management.\\nAdopting this proposal would cause unnecessary competitive harm to Tesla and undermine our efforts to recruit and retain management. The disclosures\\nrequested by the stockholder proponent, such as identification of key persons and the amelioration of their potential loss, would lead to potential\\ndisclosure of confidential and sensitive information such as our\\n \\n  Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement    27\\n--- Page 10 ---\\nTable of Contents\\n \\nbusiness strategy and outlook, our most promising internal candidates, any desirable external candidates and other factors that our Board currently\\nconsiders in the succession planning process. By publicly naming key persons and disclosing mitigation action plans, the proposal invites our\\ncompetitors to target and recruit high-value executives away from Tesla, including those who may be identified as potential successors as part of\\nsuccession planning. Furthermore, executives who are not identified as key persons or potential successors may choose to voluntarily leave Tesla and\\nmay create unwelcome tensions amongst the management team.\\nAdditionally, the Board already devotes significant time to leadership development efforts and implements several of the procedures discussed by the\\nproponent above. Through regular discussions in meetings and executive sessions at both the Board and Committee level, the Board follows certain\\nprocesses regarding the evaluation of management positions. Furthermore, the Compensation Committee provides guidance for, and reviews and\\napproves, key leadership hiring and development, and retention plans to manage and mitigate the loss of any key persons. Our directors also regularly\\ncommunicate and engage with management talent and potential successors to management positions in meetings held throughout the year, as well as\\nthrough informal events and interactions, allowing them to further identify and provide exposure to qualified successors. From an external standpoint,\\nduring Tesla‚Äôs Investor Day, held in March 2023, we provided our stockholders additional visibility into our management team.\\nAs a result, this proposal, if adopted, would constrain the ability of the Board and management to effectively oversee and manage succession planning,\\nday-to-day hiring, promotion and termination decisions, that require consideration of numerous criteria that are continually adapted to meet the ever-\\nevolving demands of a company as dynamic as Tesla.\\nIn light of the foregoing, we believe the proposal would be detrimental to the interests of Tesla and our stockholders.\\n \\nTHE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE AGAINST  THE ST OCKHOLDER PROPOSAL  REGARDING\\nREPOR TING ON KEY -PERSON  RISK.\\n \\n28    Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement   \\n--- Page 11 ---\\nTable of Contents\\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\\n \\nSuccession Planning\\nThe Board of Directors regularly discusses management succession planning in meetings and executive sessions at both the Board and Committee level.\\nAs described in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and its charter, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee periodically reviews\\nsuccession planning for the Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers, reporting its findings and recommendations to the Board and works\\nwith the Board in evaluating potential successors to these executive management positions. The Compensation Committee regularly discusses and\\nevaluates company-wide talent pools and succession plans, including short-term and long-term succession plans for development, retention and\\nreplacement of senior leaders. Directors regularly interact and engage with not only senior management talent and potential successors to executive\\nmanagement positions, but also high-potential leaders throughout the Company. This engagement occurs in Board meetings held throughout the year, as\\nwell as through informal events and updates, and regular one-on-one touchpoints.\\nCode of Business Ethics and Corporate Governance Guidelines\\nThe Board sets high standards for Tesla‚Äôs workforce, officers and directors. Tesla is committed to establishing an operating framework that exercises\\nappropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the Company and managing its affairs in a manner consistent with rigorous principles of\\nbusiness ethics. Accordingly, Tesla has adopted a Code of Business Ethics, which was amended in December 2021, and which is applicable to Tesla and\\nits subsidiaries‚Äô directors, officers and personnel. Tesla has also adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines, which, in conjunction with our certificate of\\nincorporation, bylaws and charters of the standing committees of the Board, form the framework for Tesla‚Äôs corporate governance. The Code of\\nBusiness Ethics and the Corporate Governance Guidelines are each available on Tesla‚Äôs website at: http://ir.tesla.com/corporate. Tesla will disclose on its\\nwebsite any amendment to the Code of Business Ethics, as well as any waivers of the Code of Business Ethics, that are required to be disclosed by the\\nrules of the SEC or Nasdaq.\\nDirector Independence\\nThe Board periodically assesses, with the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the independence of its members\\nas defined in the listing standards of Nasdaq and applicable laws. The Board undertook an analysis for each director and director nominee and\\nconsidered all relevant facts and circumstances, including the director‚Äôs other commercial, accounting, legal, banking, consulting, charitable and familial\\nrelationships. The Board determined that with respect to each of its current members and director nominee, other than Elon Musk, who is our Chief\\nExecutive Officer, and Kimbal Musk, who is Elon Musk‚Äôs brother, there are no disqualifying factors with respect to director independence enumerated\\nin the listing standards of Nasdaq or any relationships that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities\\nof a director, and that each such member is an ‚Äúindependent director‚Äù as defined in the listing standards of Nasdaq and applicable laws.\\nIn particular, the Board reviewed the following considerations:\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ Ira Ehrenpreis, Joe Gebbia, James Murdoch, Elon Musk, Kimbal Musk and JB Straubel and/or investment funds affiliated with them, have\\nmade minority investments in certain companies or investment funds, (i) of which other Tesla directors are founders, significant stockholders,\\ndirectors, officers or managers, and/or (ii) with which Tesla has certain relationships set forth below in ‚ÄúCertain Relationships and Related\\nParty Transactions‚ÄîRelated Party Transactions.‚Äù The Board concluded that none of these investments are material so as to impede the\\nexercise of independent judgment by any of Messrs. Ehrenpreis, Gebbia, Murdoch and Straubel.\\nBoard Leadership Structure\\nRoles of Chair of the Board\\nFollowing careful deliberation, the Board appointed Robyn Denholm to serve as the independent Chair of the Board in November 2018, having\\nconsidered her strong leadership, independent presence and financial and business expertise on the Board over an extended period of time.

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee‚Äôs\\ncriteria and process for fulfilling these duties are generally as follows:\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee regularly reviews the current composition and size of the Board, and oversees an\\nannual evaluation of the performance of the Board as a whole and of its individual members. The Nominating and Corporate Governance\\nCommittee applies uniform evaluation processes and standards for all Board members, including in identifying, considering or recommending\\nnew candidates for the Board to fill vacancies or add additional directors and in recommending existing Board members for nomination to be\\nre-elected at annual meetings of stockholders.\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ In carrying out the foregoing duties, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee consistently seeks to achieve a complementary\\nbalance of knowledge, experience and capability on the Board. While the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has not\\nestablished specific minimum qualifications for director candidates, it considers all pertinent factors that it considers appropriate, including\\ndiversity, and believes that the Board should consist of directors who (1) are predominantly independent, (2) are of high integrity, (3) have\\nbroad, business-related knowledge and experience at the policy-making level in business or technology, including their understanding of\\nTesla‚Äôs business in particular, (4) have qualifications that will increase overall Board effectiveness, (5) represent diversity of race, ethnicity,\\ngender and professional experience and (6) meet other requirements as may be required by applicable rules, such as financial literacy or\\nfinancial expertise with respect to Audit Committee members. For example, after conducting independent director searches from time to time\\nin which numerous highly-qualified candidates from a variety of backgrounds were considered, the Nominating and Corporate Governance\\nCommittee recommended to the\\n \\n36    Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement   \\n--- Page 19 ---\\nTable of Contents\\n Board Joe Gebbia as director in 2022 and JB Straubel as director nominee in 2023, respectively, to further bolster the Board‚Äôs expertise in\\ntechnological innovation, public company management and sustainability initiatives.\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ In evaluating and identifying candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has the authority to retain and terminate any\\nthird party search firm that is used to identify director candidates and has the authority to approve the fees and retention terms of any search\\nfirm.\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ With regard to any candidates who are properly recommended by stockholders (as described in more detail below) or by other sources, the\\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee will review the qualifications of any such candidate, which review may, in the\\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee‚Äôs discretion, include interviewing references for the candidate, direct interviews with the\\ncandidate or other actions that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee deems necessary or proper.\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ After completing its review and evaluation of director candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommends the\\ndirector nominees that it has determined to be qualified to the full Board.\\nIt is the policy of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to consider properly submitted recommendations for candidates to the Board\\nfrom stockholders. Stockholder recommendations for candidates to the Board must be directed in writing to Tesla, Inc., 1 Tesla Road, Austin, Texas\\n78725, Attention: Legal Department, and should also be sent by e-mail to shareholdermail@tesla.com. Such recommendations must include the\\ncandidate‚Äôs name, home and business contact information, detailed biographical data and qualifications, information regarding any relationships\\nbetween the candidate and Tesla within the last three years and evidence of the nominating person‚Äôs ownership of Tesla stock. Such recommendations\\nmust also include a statement from the recommending stockholder in support of the candidate, particularly within the context of the criteria for Board\\nmembership, including issues of character, integrity, judgment, diversity, age, independence, skills, education, expertise, business acumen, business\\nexperience, length of service, understanding of Tesla‚Äôs business, other commitments and the like, as well as any personal references and an indication of\\nthe candidate‚Äôs willingness to serve.\\nBoard Diversity\\nThe Board believes that gender and minority representation is a key element in achieving the broad range of perspectives that the Board seeks among its\\nmembers. As such, diversity is one of the important factors the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers when nominating Board\\ncandidates. Two of the four directors we added in the past four years are gender, racially and/or ethnically diverse and the chairperson of our Board is a\\nwoman. We believe that such representation promotes a culture of inclusion and diversity at Tesla. In addition, the Nominating and Corporate\\nGovernance Committee conducts annual evaluations of our Board effectiveness, providing it with an opportunity to examine whether our Board\\nmembers have the right composition of skills and experiences. The Board is committed to improving its current diversity, and the Committee continues\\nto consider opportunities, including actively reaching out to diverse candidates, with the objective of increasing our Board diversity in a way that\\nsupports the current and anticipated needs of the Company, and of achieving at least 30% gender diversity on our Board. In addition, we mandate\\nexternal search firms, when applicable, to prioritize searches for candidates with racial, ethnic and/or gender diversity.\\nBoard Diversity Matrix (As of April 6, 2023)\\n \\n    Female   Male \\nTotal Number of Directors    8  \\nGender:  \\nDirectors    2    6 \\nNumber of Directors Who Identify in Any of the Categories Below:  \\nAfrican American or Black    1    ‚Äî \\nAsian (other than South Asian)    ‚Äî    1 \\nWhite    1    5 \\nAttendance at Annual Meetings of Stockholders by the Board\\nAlthough Tesla does not have a formal policy regarding attendance by members of the Board at Tesla‚Äôs annual meetings of stockholders, directors are\\nencouraged to attend. All of our directors who served at the time of the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders attended such meeting, with seven\\nattending in person, and the remaining director joining remotely.\\n \\n  Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement    37\\n--- Page 20 ---\\nTable of Contents\\n \\nStock Transactions\\nHedging, Short Sales and Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\\nTesla has an insider trading policy that prohibits all of our directors, officers and employees from, among other things, engaging in short sales, hedging\\nor similar transactions designed to decrease the risks associated with holding Tesla securities. This prohibition encompasses transactions in publicly-\\ntraded options, such as puts and calls, and other derivative securities with respect to Tesla securities, but not transactions designed to facilitate portfolio\\ndiversification, such as broad-based index options, futures or baskets.\\nStock Ownership by Board and Management\\nTo align the interests at the highest level of our management with those of our stockholders, the Board has instituted the following requirements relating\\nto stock ownership under our Corporate Governance Guidelines.\\nEach member of the Board and all of our named executive officers are subject to the following minimum stock ownership requirements: (i) each director\\nis required to own shares of Tesla stock equal in value to at least five times the annual cash retainer for directors (regardless of whether or not the\\nretainer has been waived, and exclusive of retainer amounts for service as a member or chair of a Board committee), and (ii) our named executive\\nofficers are required to own shares of Tesla stock equal in value to at least six times his/her base salary. Each individual shall have five years from the\\ndate such person assumed his or her relevant role at Tesla to come into compliance with these requirements. Each person‚Äôs compliance with the\\nminimum stock ownership level will be determined on the date when this compliance grace period expires, and then annually on each December 31, by\\nmultiplying the number of shares held by such person and the average closing price of those shares during the preceding month. Our named executive\\nofficers and each of our directors is currently either in compliance with these requirements or is in the applicable period to come into compliance\\ntherewith.\\nOur Corporate Governance Guidelines also provide that no equity award as to which vesting or the lapse of a period of restriction occurs based solely on\\nthe passage of time that is granted to a named executive officer may vest, or have a period of restriction that lapses, earlier than six months from the date\\non which such vesting or lapse commences. Furthermore, our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that no named executive officer may sell,\\ntransfer, pledge, assign or otherwise dispose of any shares of Tesla stock acquired pursuant to any stock option, restricted stock unit or other equity\\naward granted by Tesla earlier than the date that is six months after the date on which such award vests or the period of restriction with respect to such\\naward lapses, as applicable.\\nProhibition of Equity Award Repricing\\nTesla views equity-based compensation to be a key factor in incentivizing the future performance of our personnel. Consequently, the Tesla, Inc. 2019\\nEquity Incentive Plan (the ‚Äú2019 Plan‚Äù) provides, and Tesla‚Äôs previous 2010 Equity Incentive Plan provided, that stock options and other equity awards\\nissued under these plans that derive their value from the appreciation of the value of Tesla‚Äôs stock may not be exchanged for other awards, repurchased\\nfor cash or otherwise be made the subject of transactions that have the purpose or effect of repricing such awards.\\nIn addition, applicable Nasdaq rules prohibit any repricing with respect to the performance-based stock option award granted to Elon Musk in January\\n2018.\\nContacting the Board\\nAny stockholder who desires to contact our non-employee directors regarding appropriate Tesla business-related comments may do so electronically at\\nthe following website: http://ir.tesla.com/corporate-governance/contact-the-board.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current\\nconsiderations, expectations and determinations regarding future compensation programs. The actual amount and form of compensation and the\\ncompensation programs that we adopt may differ materially from current or planned programs as summarized in this discussion.\\nThe following discussion and analysis relates to the compensation arrangements for 2022 of (i) our principal executive officer, (ii) our principal financial\\nofficer and (iii) the most highly compensated person, other than our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, who was serving as an\\nexecutive officer at the end of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 (our ‚Äúnamed executive officers‚Äù). We had no other executive officers serving at\\nthe end of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Our named executive officers for fiscal year 2022 were:\\n \\nName   Position\\nElon Musk  Technoking of Tesla and Chief Executive Officer\\nZachary Kirkhorn  Master of Coin and Chief Financial Officer\\nAndrew Baglino  Senior Vice President, Powertrain and Energy Engineering\\nCompensation Philosophy\\nOur mission is to accelerate the world‚Äôs transition to sustainable energy. This is a long-term mission, and our compensation programs reflect this‚Äîand\\nour startup origins‚Äîin that they consist primarily of salary or wages and equity awards. Whereas salary or wages are intended to meet our employees‚Äô\\nnear-term liquidity needs, we believe that equity awards are an effective tool for retaining employees long-term, as they vest incrementally over a period\\nof time or upon the achievement of specified performance milestones intended to be achieved over the medium- and long-term. During periods in which\\nour stock price and the underlying value of equity awards increase, their retention impact is even greater. We believe that the potential for such increases\\nalso creates an ownership culture that promotes holding equity, which in turn aligns the interests of our employees with the long-term interests of our\\nstockholders. For these reasons, our goal is to provide each employee with the opportunity to participate in our equity programs, with certain cash-based\\nbonus programs serving generally to accommodate specific incentive structures or liquidity needs. By combining salary or wages and our equity award\\nprogram, we strive to offer a total level of compensation that is competitive within specific roles and geographical markets.\\nIn particular, we believe that compensation for the individuals who are responsible for Tesla‚Äôs strategic direction and operations should motivate them to\\nachieve sustainable stockholder value and/or tangible milestones rather than to simply remain at Tesla or maintain the status quo. Therefore, while we\\noffer to our general employee population restricted stock units that will retain some value even if the market value of our stock decreases, we are\\nincreasingly emphasizing for our executive officers the grant of stock option awards, which have zero initial value and accumulate value, if at all, only\\nto the extent that our stock price increases following their grant, through the applicable vesting dates and until such stock options are ultimately\\nexercised and the underlying shares are sold. In addition, because equity awards comprise a greater proportion of our executive officers‚Äô total level of\\ncompensation compared to comparable roles at peer companies, a sustained decrease in our stock price or failure to achieve the applicable operational\\nmilestones may result in a level of total compensation that is significantly less than that of such peer roles. Likewise, our outside director compensation\\nprogram has consisted primarily of equity awards that are entirely in the form of stock option awards, as well as relatively modest cash retainer\\npayments that may be waived at the election of each director.\\nWe evaluate our compensation philosophy and programs regularly and evolve them as circumstances merit with oversight by the Compensation\\nCommittee, particularly with respect to executive and director compensation. For example, if our stock price experiences significant movement over a\\nshort period of time that results in a persistent change to equity compensation, certain adjustments may be considered to align our compensation\\nprograms to their intended purposes.\\n \\n40    Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement   \\n--- Page 23 ---\\nTable of Contents\\nKey Factors in Determining Executive Compensation\\nRole of Compensation Committee in Executive Compensation\\nThe Compensation Committee has the overall responsibility of recommending to the Board the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and\\nreviewing and determining the compensation of our other executive officers. Members of the Compensation Committee are appointed by the Board.\\nCurrently, the Compensation Committee consists of three members of the Board: Ira Ehrenpreis (Chair), Robyn Denholm and Kathleen Wilson-\\nThompson, none of whom is an executive officer of Tesla, and each of whom qualifies as (i) an ‚Äúindependent director‚Äù under the Nasdaq rules and\\n(ii) an ‚Äúoutside director‚Äù under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the ‚ÄúCode‚Äù). See ‚ÄúCorporate Governance‚ÄîBoard Meetings and\\nCommittees‚ÄîCompensation Committee‚Äù above.\\nRole of Compensation Consultants\\nThe Compensation Committee has the authority to engage and has from time to time engaged the services of outside consultants to assist in making\\ndecisions regarding the establishment of Tesla‚Äôs compensation philosophy and programs, including for executives and directors. For example,\\nCompensia, Inc., a national compensation consulting firm (‚ÄúCompensia‚Äù), was retained as a compensation consultant in 2021 to advise the\\nCompensation Committee with respect to Tesla‚Äôs compensation program for its non-employee directors. Compensia advised the Compensation\\nCommittee on the design of the Board‚Äôs equity award program for the future period until the Compensation Committee‚Äôs and Board‚Äôs next review of the\\nprogram, including a consideration of Tesla‚Äôs exceptional performance and commitment to at-risk director compensation in the form of annual stock\\noption awards to ensure continued alignment of the interests of directors with those of Tesla‚Äôs stockholders. See ‚ÄúExecutive Compensation‚Äî\\nCompensation of Directors‚ÄîNon-Employee Director Compensation Arrangements‚Äù below for more detail regarding the review of Board compensation\\nduring 2022. Compensia did not provide any services to us in 2022.\\nRole of Executive Officers in Compensation Decisions\\nHistorically, for executive officers other than our Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee has sought and considered input from our Chief\\nExecutive Officer regarding such executive officers‚Äô responsibilities, performance and compensation. Specifically, our Chief Executive Officer\\nrecommends base salary increases and equity award levels for our senior personnel, and advises the Compensation Committee regarding the\\ncompensation program‚Äôs ability to attract, retain and motivate executive talent. These recommendations reflect compensation levels that our Chief\\nExecutive Officer believes are qualitatively commensurate with an executive officer‚Äôs individual qualifications, experience, responsibility level,\\nfunctional role, knowledge, skills and individual performance, as well as Tesla‚Äôs performance. The Compensation Committee considers our Chief\\nExecutive Officer‚Äôs recommendations, but ultimately determines compensation in its judgment, and approves the specific compensation for all of our\\nexecutive officers (other than for our Chief Executive Officer, which is approved by the Board). All such compensation determinations by our\\nCompensation Committee are largely discretionary.\\nThe Compensation Committee meets regularly in executive session. Our Chief Executive Officer is not present during Compensation Committee\\ndeliberations or votes on his compensation and also recuses himself from sessions of the Board where the Board acts on the Compensation Committee‚Äôs\\nrecommendations regarding his compensation. In addition, the Board has established a management committee under the 2019 Plan (the ‚ÄúEquity Award\\nCommittee‚Äù) to grant and administer equity awards, subject to certain maximum limits on the seniority of personnel to whom the Equity Award\\nCommittee may grant awards and the value of any individual award. For example, the Equity Award Committee is not authorized to grant awards to\\nexecutive officer-level employees. Moreover, pursuant to applicable law, the Equity Award Committee may not grant awards to its members, and the\\nnumber of shares of our common stock underlying awards granted by it may not exceed amounts determined by the Board from time to time. The Board\\nhas delegated to the Compensation Committee oversight authority over the Equity Award Committee.\\nRole of Stockholder Say-on-Pay Votes\\nAt the 2011 annual meeting of our stockholders and at each annual meeting held every three years since, including most recently in 2020, we held\\ntriennial stockholder advisory ‚Äúsay-on-pay‚Äù votes on the compensation of our named executive officers for the immediately preceding fiscal years. At\\nour 2020 annual meeting, our stockholders overwhelmingly approved the compensation of our named executive officers, with approximately 83% of our\\nstockholders present and entitled to vote at the meeting voting in favor of our compensation policies for our named executive officers. Given these\\nresults, the Compensation Committee has decided to retain our overall approach to executive compensation while continuing to\\n \\n  Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement    41\\n--- Page 24 ---\\nTable of Contents\\n \\nevaluate our practices frequently, including in response to future say-on-pay votes. Moreover, we are required to hold a vote at least every six years\\nregarding how often to hold a stockholder advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers. We held our most recent such vote at the\\n2017 annual meeting of stockholders, at which our stockholders indicated a preference for a triennial vote. In accordance with this triennial frequency,\\nwe will again hold a say-on-pay advisory vote at the 2023 Annual Meeting. See ‚ÄúProposal Two‚ÄîTesla Proposal for Non-Binding Advisory Vote on\\nExecutive Compensation.‚Äù We will also hold our say-on-pay frequency vote at the 2023 Annual Meeting. See ‚ÄúProposal Three‚ÄîTesla Proposal for Non-\\nBinding Advisory Vote on the Frequency of the Future Non-Binding Vote on Executive Compensation.‚Äù\\nClawback Policy\\nOur Corporate Governance Guidelines sets forth a compensation recovery (‚Äúclawback‚Äù) policy with respect to any annual incentive payment or long-\\nterm incentive payment that may be received by an executive officer, where such payment would be predicated upon achieving certain financial results\\nthat were subsequently the subject of a restatement of our financial statements, and a lower payment would have been made to the executive based upon\\nthe restated financial results. In such case, the Board has the authority to seek to recover from the executive officer the amount by which such officer‚Äôs\\nincentive payments for the relevant period exceeded the lower payment that would have been made based on the restated financial results.\\nMoreover, the terms of the 2018 CEO Performance Award include a clawback provision in the event of a restatement of our financial statements\\npreviously filed with the SEC. See ‚ÄúExecutive Compensation‚ÄîCompensation Discussion and Analysis‚ÄîChief Executive Officer Compensation‚Äî2018\\nCEO Performance Award‚Äù below.\\nCurrent Elements of Named Executive Officer Compensation\\nOverview and Fiscal Year 2022 Company Highlights\\nOur current executive compensation program, which was developed and approved by the Compensation Committee, generally consists of base salary\\nand equity-based incentives, as well as other benefits generally available to employees. We combine these elements in order to formulate compensation\\npackages with the goal of providing, on a total basis, competitive pay and align the interests of our named executive officers with long-term stockholder\\ninterests by tying the value of their compensation to our long-term stock price and/or the achievement of financial, operational and strategic objectives.\\nIn 2022, Tesla‚Äôs full-year accomplishments under our executive leadership included the following:\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ Total revenues of $81.46 billion, representing an increase of $27.64 billion, or 51.4%, compared to the prior year;\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ Net income attributable to common stockholders of $12.56 billion and an operating margin of 16.8%, representing favorable changes of\\n$7.04 billion and 4.6%, respectively, compared to the prior year;\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ Annual vehicle delivery and production records of 1,313,851 and 1,369,611 total vehicles, representing an increase of 40.3% and 47.2%,\\nrespectively, compared to the prior year;\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ 6.5 gigawatt hours of energy storage and 348 megawatts of solar energy systems deployed; and\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ Ongoing progress in the global growth of our manufacturing capabilities, including production and ramp at Gigafactory Texas and\\nGigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and our Megafactory in Lathrop, CA.\\nBase Salary\\nThe Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing our Chief Executive Officer‚Äôs and other executive officers‚Äô base salaries. The base salaries of\\nall executive officers are reviewed and adjusted when necessary to reflect individual roles, performance and the competitive market. Because we\\ncurrently do not provide cash bonuses to our executive officers, salary is the primary cash-based element of our executive officers‚Äô compensation\\nstructure.\\n \\n42    Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement   \\n--- Page 25 ---\\nTable of Contents\\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the annualized base salary rates at the end of 2022 for our named executive officers:\\n \\nName   2022\\nFiscal Year-End\\nBase\\nSalary($)(1) \\nElon Musk   ‚Äî(2) \\nZachary Kirkhorn   300,000 \\nAndrew Baglino   300,000 \\n \\n (1) Reflects an annualized rate assuming 52 weeks each consisting of five work days.\\n (2) Mr. Musk historically earned a base salary that reflected the applicable minimum wage\\nrequirements under California law, and he was subject to income taxes based on such base\\nsalary. However, he has never accepted his salary. Commencing in May 2019 at Mr. Musk‚Äôs\\nrequest, we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary. \\nEquity-Based Incentives\\nOur equity award program is the primary vehicle for offering long-term incentives to our named executive officers. The equity awards we have\\nhistorically granted and currently grant are options to purchase shares of our common stock and restricted stock unit awards that are settled in shares of\\nour common stock upon vesting. We have granted to our named executive officers both awards that vest over a long-term period and awards that vest\\nonly upon the achievement of specified Tesla performance milestones, in each case subject to continued service. We are increasingly emphasizing the\\ngrant of stock option awards for our named executive officers, which have value only to the extent, if any, that our stock price increases following their\\ngrant. Accordingly, all equity awards granted to our named executive officers in 2020 (the last year awards were granted to any of our named executive\\nofficers) were in the form of stock option awards. As a result, a significant portion of our named executive officers‚Äô total compensation is entirely at risk,\\ndepending on long-term stock price performance.\\nWhile we strive to offer a total level of compensation that is competitive within specific roles and geographical markets, we do not have a rigid set of\\ncriteria for granting equity awards; instead, the Compensation Committee exercises its judgment and discretion, in consultation with our Chief\\nExecutive Officer and from time to time, a compensation consultant. The Compensation Committee considers, among other things, the role and\\nresponsibility of the named executive officer, competitive market factors, the amount of stock-based equity compensation already held by the named\\nexecutive officer, the impact of any dramatic changes in our stock price over a short period of time and the cash-based compensation received by the\\nnamed executive officer, to determine the level and types of equity awards that it approves. We generally grant one-time new hire equity awards to our\\nemployees, including executives, upon their commencement of employment with us, or upon their promotion to a new position. Additionally, as part of\\nour ongoing executive compensation review and alignment process, we periodically grant additional equity awards to our executives, although no such\\nequity awards were granted in fiscal 2022. See ‚ÄúExecutive Compensation‚ÄîGrants of Plan-Based Awards in 2022‚Äù below.\\nThe Compensation Committee meets periodically, including to approve equity award grants to our executives from time to time. We do not have, nor do\\nwe plan to establish, any program, plan or practice to time equity award grants in coordination with releasing material non-public information.\\nSeverance and Change in Control Benefits\\nNo named executive officer has a severance or change in control arrangement with Tesla.\\nBonus\\nWe do not currently have or have planned, and historically we have rarely entered into, any specific arrangements with our named executive officers\\nproviding for cash-based bonus awards.\\n \\n  Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement    43\\n--- Page 26 ---\\nTable of Contents\\n \\nNon-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation\\nWe did not provide any non-equity incentive plan compensation to any of our named executive officers in 2022, and we do not currently have or have\\nplanned any specific arrangements with our named executive officers providing for non-equity incentive plan compensation.\\nPerquisites\\nGenerally, we do not provide any perquisites or other personal benefits to our named executive officers.\\nHealth and Welfare Benefits\\nWe provide the following benefits to our named executive officers on the same basis provided to all of our employees:\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ medical insurance including comprehensive transgender and fertility coverage, mental health, dental and vision;\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ adoption and surrogacy benefits;\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ confidential Employee Assistance Program counseling;\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment insurance;\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ a Section 401(k) plan where, beginning in 2022, Tesla provides a company match equal to 50% of the employee‚Äôs contribution, up to a\\nmaximum of 3% of the employee‚Äôs eligible compensation with a $3,000 annual cap;\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ an employee stock purchase plan;\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ short-and long-term disability insurance;\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ medical and dependent care flexible spending account; and\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ a health savings account.\\nChief Executive Officer Compensation\\nOverview\\nHistorically, in developing compensation recommendations for our Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee has sought both to\\nappropriately reward our Chief Executive Officer‚Äôs previous and current contributions and to create incentives for our Chief Executive Officer to\\ncontinue to contribute significantly to successful results in the future. Each of the 2018 CEO Performance Award and the performance-based stock\\noption award granted to our Chief Executive Officer in August 2012 (the ‚Äú2012 CEO Performance Award‚Äù) was focused on this latter objective, as it\\nsolely rewards future performance.\\nIn addition to serving as our Chief Executive Officer since October 2008, Elon Musk has contributed significantly and actively to Tesla since our earliest\\ndays in April 2004 by recruiting executives and engineers, contributing to vehicle engineering and design, raising capital for us, bringing investors to us\\nand raising our public awareness.\\nCash Compensation\\nMr. Musk historically earned a base salary that reflected the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law, and he was subject to income\\ntaxes based on such base salary. However, he has never accepted his salary. Commencing in May 2019 at Mr. Musk‚Äôs request, we eliminated altogether\\nthe earning and accrual of this base salary.\\nHistorical Equity Compensation\\nPrior to stock option awards made in December 2009, Mr. Musk did not receive any equity compensation for his services for a period of five years.\\nIn 2010 and 2011, Mr. Musk did not receive any equity grants, because the Compensation Committee believed his grants made in December 2009\\nalready provided sufficient motivation for Mr. Musk to perform his duties as Chief Executive Officer.\\nIn August 2012, to create incentives for continued long-term success from the then-recently launched Model S program as well as from Tesla‚Äôs then-\\nplanned Model X and Model 3 programs, and to further align executive compensation with\\n \\n44    Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement   \\n--- Page 27 ---\\nTable of Contents\\nincreases in stockholder value, the Board granted to Mr. Musk the 2012 CEO Performance Award, comprised of a stock option award to purchase\\n79,123,515 shares (as adjusted for the 2020 Stock Split and 2022 Stock Split) of Tesla‚Äôs common stock, representing 5% of Tesla‚Äôs total issued and\\noutstanding shares at the time of grant. The 2012 CEO Performance Award consisted of 10 equal vesting tranches, each requiring that Tesla meet a\\ncombination of (i) the achievement of a specified operational milestone relating to development of Model X or Model 3, aggregate vehicle production or\\na gross margin target, and (ii) a sustained incremental $4 billion increase in Tesla‚Äôs market capitalization from $3.2 billion, Tesla‚Äôs market capitalization\\nat the time of grant. Prior to its expiration in 2022, the market capitalization conditions for all of the 10 vesting tranches and nine of the 10 operational\\nmilestones had been achieved, and nine of 10 tranches under the 2012 CEO Performance Award vested.\\nPrior to 2018, the only additional equity awards received by Mr. Musk related to certain immaterial awards granted during 2013 pursuant to a patent\\nincentive program that was available to our employees generally.\\n2018 CEO Performance Award\\nEarly in 2017, with the 2012 CEO Performance Award heading to substantial completion after having helped Tesla grow its market capitalization to over\\n$55 billion in just over five years, the independent members of the Board began preliminary discussions regarding how to continue to incentivize\\nMr. Musk to lead Tesla through the next phase of its development. In January 2018, following more than six months of careful analysis and development\\nled by the Compensation Committee, with participation by every independent Board member, the help of Compensia and engagement with and feedback\\nfrom our largest institutional stockholders, the Board granted the 2018 CEO Performance Award to Mr. Musk. Such grant was subject to approval by a\\nmajority of the total votes of Tesla common stock not owned by Mr. Musk or Kimbal Musk cast at a meeting of the stockholders to approve the 2018\\nCEO Performance Award. On March 21, 2018, such approval was obtained, with approximately 73% of the votes cast by such disinterested shares\\nvoting in favor of the 2018 CEO Performance Award.\\nThe 2018 CEO Performance Award was comprised of a 10-year maximum term stock option to purchase 303,960,630 shares (as adjusted for the 2020\\nStock Split and 2022 Stock Split) of Tesla‚Äôs common stock, divided equally among 12 separate tranches that were each equivalent to 1% of the issued\\nand outstanding shares of Tesla‚Äôs common stock at the time of grant, at an exercise price of $23.34 per share (as adjusted for the 2020 Stock Split and\\n2022 Stock Split). Each of the 12 tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award vested upon certification by the Board that both (i) the market\\ncapitalization milestone for such tranche, which began at $100 billion for the first tranche and increased by increments of $50 billion thereafter and\\n(ii) any one of the following eight operational milestones focused on revenue or eight operational milestones focused on profitability, was met:\\n \\nTotal Revenue*\\n(in billions)   Adjusted EBITDA**\\n(in billions)  \\n$20.0  $ 1.5 \\n$35.0  $ 3.0 \\n$55.0  $ 4.5 \\n$75.0  $ 6.0 \\n$100.0  $ 8.0 \\n$125.0  $ 10.0 \\n$150.0  $ 12.0 \\n$175.0  $ 14.0 \\n \\n * ‚ÄúRevenue‚Äù means total revenues as reported in Tesla‚Äôs financial statements on Forms 10-Q or\\n10-K filed with the SEC for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters. \\n ** ‚ÄúAdjusted EBITDA‚Äù means (i) net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before\\n(ii) interest expense, (iii) (benefit) provision for income taxes, (iv) depreciation and\\namortization and (v) stock-based compensation, as each such item is reported in Tesla‚Äôs\\nfinancial statements on Forms 10-Q or 10-K filed with the SEC for the previous four\\nconsecutive fiscal quarters. \\n \\n  Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement    45\\n--- Page 28 ---\\nTable of Contents\\n \\nAny single operational milestone could only satisfy the vesting requirement of one tranche, together with the corresponding market capitalization\\nmilestone. Subject to any applicable clawback provisions, policies or other forfeiture terms, once a milestone was achieved, it was forever deemed\\nachieved for purposes of determining the vesting of a tranche. Meeting more than 12 of the 16 operational milestones does not result in any additional\\nvesting or other compensation to Mr. Musk under the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Except in a change in control situation, measurement of the\\nmarket capitalization milestones was based on both (i) a six calendar month trailing average of Tesla‚Äôs stock price as well as (ii) a 30 calendar day\\ntrailing average of Tesla‚Äôs stock price, in each case based on trading days only. Upon the consummation of certain acquisitions or split-up, spin-off or\\ndivestiture transactions, each then-unachieved market capitalization milestone and/or operational milestone would have been adjusted to offset the\\nimpact of such transactions to the extent they had been considered material to the achievement of those milestones.\\nIn establishing the Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA milestones, the Board carefully considered a variety of factors, including Tesla‚Äôs growth trajectory\\nand internal growth plans and the historical performance of other high-growth and high-multiples companies in the technology space that have invested\\nin new businesses and tangible assets. These benchmarks provided revenue/EBITDA to market capitalization multiples, which were then used to inform\\nthe specific operational targets that aligned with Tesla‚Äôs plans for future growth. Nevertheless, the Board considered each of the market capitalization\\nand operational milestones to be challenging hurdles. For example, in order to meet all 12 market capitalization milestones, Tesla was required to add\\napproximately $600 billion to its market capitalization at the time of the grant of the 2018 CEO Performance Award on a sustained basis, and in order to\\nsatisfy all eight revenue-based operational milestones, Tesla would have to increase revenue by more than $163 billion from its annual revenue of\\napproximately $11.8 billion in 2017, the last fiscal year completed prior to the grant of the 2018 CEO Performance Award.\\nIn addition, Mr. Musk was required to continue leading Tesla as our Chief Executive Officer or, alternatively, as our Chief Product Officer and Executive\\nChairman (with any other Chief Executive Officer reporting directly to him), at the time each milestone was met in order for the corresponding tranche\\nto vest. With limited exceptions, Mr. Musk must hold any shares that he acquires upon exercise of the 2018 CEO Performance Award for at least five\\nyears post-exercise. There would have been no acceleration of vesting of the 2018 CEO Performance award upon Mr. Musk‚Äôs termination, death or\\ndisability or a change in control of Tesla. However, in a change in control situation, the achievement of the milestones would have been based solely on\\nthe market capitalization milestones, with the measurement of Tesla‚Äôs market capitalization determined by the product of the total number of outstanding\\nshares of Tesla common stock immediately before the change in control multiplied by the greater of the last closing price of a share of Tesla common\\nstock before the effective time of the change in control or the per share price (plus the per share value of any other consideration) received by Tesla‚Äôs\\nstockholders in the change in control.\\nIn the event of a restatement of Tesla‚Äôs financial statements previously filed with the SEC, if a lesser portion of the 2018 CEO Performance Award\\nwould have vested based on the restated financial results, then Tesla will require forfeiture (or repayment, as applicable) of the portion of the 2018 CEO\\nPerformance Award that would not have vested based on the restated financial results (less any amounts Mr. Musk may have paid to Tesla in exercising\\nany forfeited awards). The 2018 CEO Performance Award is subject, if more stringent than the foregoing, to any current or future Tesla clawback policy\\napplicable to equity awards, provided that the policy does not discriminate solely against Mr. Musk except as required by applicable law.\\nAs of the date of this filing, all of the milestones have been achieved and certified by our Board. Consequently, all 12 of the 12 tranches under the 2018\\nCEO Performance Award, corresponding to options to purchase an aggregate 303,960,630 shares of Tesla‚Äôs common stock, have vested and become\\nexercisable, subject to Mr. Musk‚Äôs payment of the exercise price of $23.34 per share and the minimum five-year holding period generally applicable to\\nany shares he acquires upon exercise.\\nRealized Compensation\\nFor purposes of the table in ‚ÄúExecutive Compensation‚ÄîSummary Compensation Table‚Äù below, we are required to report pursuant to applicable SEC\\nrules any stock option grants to Mr. Musk at values determined as of their respective grant dates and which are driven by certain assumptions prescribed\\nby Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, ‚ÄúCompensation‚ÄìStock Compensation‚Äù (‚ÄúASC Topic 718‚Äù).\\nMoreover, we are required to report in ‚ÄúExecutive Compensation‚ÄîPay Ratio Disclosure‚Äù below (i) Mr. Musk‚Äôs annual total compensation, (ii) the\\nmedian of the annual total compensation of all Tesla employees qualifying for this analysis, other than Mr. Musk, in each case calculated pursuant to the\\nmethodology used for the table in ‚ÄúExecutive Compensation‚ÄîSummary Compensation Table,‚Äù and (iii) the ratio of the former to the latter.\\n \\n46    Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement   \\n--- Page 29 ---\\nTable of Contents\\nIn addition, we are required to report in ‚ÄúExecutive Compensation‚Äî2022 Option Exercises and Stock Vested‚Äù below an amount for the ‚Äúvalue realized‚Äù\\nupon: (i) any exercise by Mr. Musk of a stock option, which is based on the difference between the market price of the underlying shares at the time of\\nexercise and the exercise price of the stock option and (ii) any vesting of a restricted stock unit award, based on the market price of the award at the time\\nof vesting. Such amount is required to be reported even if Mr. Musk does not actually receive any cash from such exercise or vesting, either because he\\ndoes not also sell any shares or because he sells only a number of shares sufficient to cover the related tax liabilities resulting from the exercise or\\nvesting.\\nAs a result, there may be a significant disconnect between what is reported as compensation for Mr. Musk in a given year in such sections and the value\\nactually realized as compensation in that year or over a period of time. Moreover, the vast majority of compensation in respect of past stock option\\ngrants to Mr. Musk, including the 2012 CEO Performance Award and the 2018 CEO Performance Award, were structured to be incentives for future\\nperformance with their value realizable only if Tesla‚Äôs stock price appreciated compared to the dates of the grants, and if the Company achieved\\napplicable vesting requirements.\\nTo supplement the disclosures in ‚ÄúExecutive Compensation‚ÄîSummary Compensation Table,‚Äù ‚ÄúExecutive Compensation‚ÄîPay Ratio Disclosure‚Äù and\\n‚ÄúExecutive Compensation‚Äî2022 Option Exercises and Stock Vested‚Äù below, we have included the following table, which shows the total realized\\ncompensation of Mr. Musk for the last three fiscal years, as well as the ratio of Mr. Musk‚Äôs realized compensation to the median of the annual total\\ncompensation of all other Tesla employees qualifying for this analysis as reported in ‚ÄúExecutive Compensation‚ÄîPay Ratio Disclosure.‚Äù Realized\\ncompensation is not a substitute for reported compensation in evaluating our compensation structure, but we believe that realized compensation is an\\nimportant factor in understanding that the value of compensation that Mr. Musk ultimately realizes is dependent on a number of additional factors,\\nincluding: (i) the vesting of certain of his option awards only upon the successful achievement of a number of market capitalization increase and\\noperational milestone targets; (ii) the fact that Mr. Musk does not receive any cash if he does not actually sell shares and thereby reduce his investment\\nin us, and he does not receive any cash to the extent that he sells only shares sufficient to cover income taxes with respect to his awards (including stock\\noptions exercised solely to avoid their expiration in accordance with their terms); and (iii) the then-current market value of our common stock at the\\ntimes at which Mr. Musk may elect to actually sell his shares.\\n \\n  Year  ‚ÄúTotal Compensation‚Äù of\\nCEO,\\nas Reported in Summary\\nCompensation Table\\nBelow\\n($)  ‚ÄúValue Realized on Exercise\\nor Vesting of Awards‚Äù of\\nCEO, as\\nReported in\\nOption Exercises\\nand Stock Vested Table\\nBelow\\n($)   Median Annual Total\\nCompensation of all\\nQualifying\\nNon-CEO\\nEmployees,\\nas reported in Pay\\nRatio Disclosure\\nSection Below\\n($)   Total CEO\\nRealized\\nCompensation\\n($)(1)   Ratio of Total\\nCEO Realized\\nCompensation to\\nMedian Annual\\nTotal Compensation\\nof all Qualifying\\nNon-CEO\\nEmployees  \\n2022  ‚Äî  ‚Äî   34,084   ‚Äî   0.00:1 \\n2021  ‚Äî  23,452,910,177(2)   40,723   734,762,107   18,043:1 \\n2020  ‚Äî  ‚Äî   46,150   ‚Äî   0.00:1 \\n \\n(1)‚ÄúTotal CEO realized compensation‚Äù for a given year is defined as (i) the amounts reported for Mr. Musk in ‚ÄúExecutive Compensation‚ÄîSummary\\nCompensation Table‚Äù below under the columns ‚ÄúSalary,‚Äù ‚ÄúBonus,‚Äù ‚ÄúNon-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation‚Äù and ‚ÄúAll Other Compensation,‚Äù\\nplus (ii) with respect to any stock option exercised by Mr. Musk in such year in connection with which shares of stock were also sold other than to\\nsatisfy any resulting tax liability, the difference between the market price of such shares at the time of exercise and the applicable exercise price of\\nthe option, plus (iii) with respect to any restricted stock unit vested by Mr. Musk in such year in connection with which shares of stock were also\\nsold other than automatic sales to satisfy any withholding obligations related to such vesting, the market price of such shares at the time of vesting,\\nplus (iv) any cash actually received by Mr. Musk in respect of any shares sold to cover tax liabilities as described in (ii) and (iii) above, following\\nthe payment of such tax liabilities.\\n(2)Reflects the exercise of vested stock options scheduled to expire in 2022 as to which Mr. Musk paid the exercise price in cash.

We have not provided or committed to provide any executive officer or director with a gross-up or other reimbursement for tax\\namounts the executive might pay pursuant to Section 280G or Section 409A of the Code. Section 280G and related Code sections provide that executive\\nofficers, directors who hold significant stockholder interests and certain other service providers could be subject to significant additional taxes if they\\nreceive payments or benefits in connection with a change in control of Tesla that exceeds certain limits, and that we or our successor could lose a\\ndeduction on the amounts subject to the additional tax. Section 409A also imposes additional significant taxes on the individual in the event that an\\nexecutive officer, director or service provider of certain types receives ‚Äúdeferred compensation‚Äù that does not meet the requirements of Section 409A.\\nTax Deduction Limit. Section 162(m) of the Code generally disallows a tax deduction to public corporations for compensation greater than $1,000,000\\npaid in any fiscal year to certain executive officers. However, prior to the enactment of U.S. tax legislation in December 2017 (the ‚ÄúTax Act‚Äù), certain\\ntypes of performance-based compensation were excluded from the $1,000,000 deduction limit if specific requirements were met. Under the Tax Act, this\\nexclusion for performance-based compensation is not available with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, unless the\\ncompensation is pursuant to a written binding contract which was in effect on or before November 2, 2017, and which is not modified in any material\\nrespect on or after such date. Pursuant to the Tax Act, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, Section 162(m) of the Code was expanded\\nto cover additional executive officers and other employees, including the chief financial officer, so that the compensation of the chief executive officer\\nand chief financial officer (at any time during the fiscal year), the three next most highly compensated executive officers during the taxable year and any\\nother individual who was considered a ‚Äúcovered employee‚Äù for any prior taxable year that begins after 2016, will be subject to the $1,000,000\\ndeductibility limit under Section 162(m) of the Code. Commencing with our 2018 fiscal year, to the extent that the aggregate amount of any covered\\nofficer‚Äôs salary, bonus, any amount realized from certain option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units or other equity awards, and certain other\\ncompensation amounts that are recognized as taxable income by the officer exceeds $1,000,000, we will not be entitled to a U.S. federal income tax\\ndeduction for the amount over $1,000,000 in that year, unless the compensation qualifies for the transition relief applicable to certain written binding\\ncontracts in effect on or before November 2, 2017. The Compensation Committee has not adopted a formal policy regarding tax deductibility of\\ncompensation paid to our executive officers and reserves the right to pay compensation that may not be deductible to Tesla if it determines that doing so\\nwould be in the best interests of Tesla.\\nAccounting Implications. We follow ASC Topic 718 for our stock-based compensation awards. ASC Topic 718 requires companies to measure the\\ncompensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards made to employees and directors based on the grant date ‚Äúfair value‚Äù of these awards.\\nThis calculation is performed for accounting purposes and reported in the compensation tables below, even though our named executive officers may\\nnever realize any value from their awards.

Moreover, Elon Musk, the Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive\\nOfficer, has agreed to a compensation arrangement in the 2018 CEO Performance Award that is substantially tied to the appreciation of our market\\ncapitalization. Because equity awards are generally made available to Tesla employees, this also means that Mr. Musk‚Äôs compensation is tied to the\\nsuccess of Tesla employees. We are providing a ratio of (i) Mr. Musk‚Äôs 2022 annual total compensation to (ii) the median of the 2022 annual total\\ncompensation of all applicable qualifying Tesla employees other than Mr. Musk, in each case calculated pursuant to the disclosure requirements of\\n‚ÄúExecutive Compensation‚ÄîSummary Compensation Table‚Äù above. As we continue our international expansion, the median annual total compensation of\\nour employees reflects differences in local compensation scales and practices abroad to a greater extent.\\nMr. Musk‚Äôs 2022 annual total compensation, as reported in ‚ÄúExecutive Compensation‚ÄîSummary Compensation Table,‚Äù was $0, and the median 2022\\nannual total compensation of all other qualifying employees, as determined pursuant to the methodology set forth below, was $34,084. Consequently, the\\napplicable ratio of such amounts for 2022 was 0.00:1.\\nOur methodology for identifying the median of the 2022 annual total compensation for each individual other than Mr. Musk was as follows:\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ We selected December 31, 2022, which is within the last three months of 2022, as the date upon which we would identify the ‚Äúmedian\\nemployee‚Äù because it enabled us to make such identification in a reasonably efficient and economical manner.\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ We determined that as of December 31, 2022, Tesla and all our subsidiaries had 126,771 individuals qualifying for this analysis (full-time,\\npart-time and temporary employees other than Mr. Musk, subject to the following bullet), of which approximately 44% were based outside\\nof the U.S. and approximately 42% were production line employees.\\n \\n  Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement    49\\n--- Page 32 ---\\nTable of Contents\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ We did not include in the population of qualifying individuals any employees of staffing agencies whose compensation is determined by\\nsuch agencies.\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ We applied the requirements and assumptions required for the table in ‚ÄúExecutive Compensation‚ÄîSummary Compensation Table‚Äù for each\\nof such individuals to calculate the total annual compensation, including base salary or wages, performance-based commission payments,\\nand equity awards based on their grant date fair values.\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ We converted any payment earned or paid in a foreign currency to U.S. dollar using the average of the prevailing conversion rates for the\\nmonth of December 2022.\\n \\n ‚Ä¢ We selected the median of all total annual compensation amounts calculated in accordance with the foregoing.\\nPay Versus Performance \\nIn accordance with Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K, we are\\nrequired to disclose certain information about the relationship between the compensation actually paid to our named executive officers and certain\\nmeasures of company performance.

Over this same period, TSR decreased by 65.0%, net income\\nincreased by 123.0%, and revenue increased by 51.4%.\\nFrom 2020 to 2021, compensation actually paid to the CEO decreased by 65.1%. Over this same period, TSR increased by 49.8%, net income increased\\nby 554.8%, and revenue increased by 70.7%.\\nMr. Musk does not earn a base salary or receive any equity compensation other than under his 2012 CEO Performance Award and 2018 CEO\\nPerformance Award. See ‚ÄúExecutive Compensation‚ÄîCompensation Discussion and Analysis‚ÄîChief Executive Officer Compensation‚Äù for more\\ninformation.\\nThe vesting of Mr. Musk‚Äôs awards were tied to specific market capitalization and operational milestones focusing on total revenue and adjusted\\nEBITDA. However, the compensation actually paid as calculated pursuant to Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K is based on the accounting changes in the\\nfair value of such options, which varies significantly with the performance of our common stock.\\nThus, because the Company TSR is calculated from the beginning of the earliest year presented, a positive TSR does not necessarily correlate to an\\nincrease in compensation actually paid if the increase in TSR is less significant relative to a prior year. In addition, due to the fact that Mr. Musk did not\\nreceive any additional equity grants following the 2018 CEO Performance Award, his amount of total compensation actually paid decreased because the\\nnumber of unvested options decreased year over year upon the vesting of tranches of the award. Because the 2018 CEO Performance Award has fully\\nvested, Mr. Musk‚Äôs compensation actually paid will converge to $0 unless he receives a new grant.\\n \\n52    Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement    \\n--- Page 34 ---\\nTable of Contents \\nWhile a positive TSR may not align with an increase in compensation actually paid, as further demonstrated by the following graph, any decreases in\\nTSR would align to decreases in compensation actually paid.\\n \\nOther NEOs\\nFrom 2021 to 2022, compensation actually paid to the other NEOs decreased by 122.5%.

Over this same period, TSR increased by 49.8%, net income\\nincreased by 554.8%, and revenue increased by 70.7%.\\nThough our other NEOs do receive a base salary, a significant portion of their compensation actually paid consists of equity awards. As the\\ncompensation actually paid as calculated pursuant to Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K, is based on the accounting changes in the fair value of such\\noptions, the value varies significantly with the performance of our common stock. Thus, because the Company TSR is calculated from the beginning of\\nthe earliest year presented, a positive TSR does not necessarily correlate to an increase in compensation actually paid if the increase in TSR is less\\nsignificant relative to a prior year. In addition, due to the fact that our other NEOs did not receive any additional equity grants after 2020, their amount\\nof total compensation actually paid decreased because the number of unvested options decreased year over year.\\nFrom 2020 to 2021, some of the decrease in compensation actually paid to our other NEOs was a result of Jerome Guillen‚Äôs departure in June 2021,\\nwhich led to certain forfeitures of unvested awards.\\n \\n  Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement    53\\n--- Page 35 ---\\nTable of Contents\\n \\nWhile a positive TSR may not align with an increase in compensation actually paid, as further demonstrated by the following graph, any decreases in\\nTSR would align with decreases in compensation actually paid.\\n \\nCumulative TSR of the Company and Cumulative TSR of the Peer Group\\nThe following chart compares our cumulative TSR over the three most recently completed fiscal years to that of our peer group‚Äôs TSR over the same\\nperiod.\\n \\nGrants of Plan-Based Awards in 2022 \\nNo equity-based awards were granted to any named executive officer in fiscal year 2022.\\n \\n54    Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement   \\n--- Page 36 ---\\nTable of Contents \\nOutstanding Equity Awards at 2022 Fiscal Year-End \\nThe following table presents information concerning unexercised options and unvested restricted stock unit awards for each named executive officer\\noutstanding as of the end of fiscal 2022.\\n \\n     Option Awards   Stock Awards  \\n  Name  Grant Date  Number of\\nSecurities\\nUnderlying\\nUnexercised\\nOptions (#)\\nExercisable  Number of\\nSecurities\\nUnderlying\\nUnexercised\\nOptions (#)\\nUnexercisable  Equity\\nIncentive\\nPlan\\nAwards:\\nNumber of\\nSecurities\\nUnderlying\\nUnexercised\\nUnearned\\nOptions (#)  Option\\nExercise\\nPrice ($)  Option\\nExpiration\\nDate  Number of\\nShares or\\nUnits of\\nStock That\\nHave Not\\nVested\\n(#)   Market\\nValue of\\nShares or\\nUnits of Stock\\nThat Have\\nNot Vested\\n($)(1)  \\nElon Musk   3/21/2018(2)   278,630,565   25,330,065   ‚Äî   23.34   1/19/2028   ‚Äî   ‚Äî \\n  6/10/2013(3)   5,250   ‚Äî   ‚Äî   6.67   6/10/2023   ‚Äî   ‚Äî \\n  4/8/2013(3)   5,250   ‚Äî   ‚Äî   2.79   4/8/2023   ‚Äî   ‚Äî \\nZachary J.

Moreover, while we offer to our general employee population restricted stock units that\\nwill retain some value even if the market value of our stock decreases, the equity-based compensation to our directors has been exclusively in the form\\nof stock options, which have zero initial value and accumulate value, if at all, only to the extent that our stock price increases following their grant,\\nthrough the applicable vesting dates and until such stock options are ultimately exercised and the underlying shares are sold. The remaining portion of\\nour directors‚Äô compensation has consisted of cash retainer payments that are relatively modest compared to peer companies and that may be waived at\\nthe election of each director. Consequently, a large portion and in some cases, the entirety, of each of our non-employee directors‚Äô compensation is\\nentirely at risk, and fluctuating stock prices have at times resulted in 100% of the vested stock options then held by each of our non-employee directors\\nbeing out-of-the-money.\\nIn 2020 and 2021, the Compensation Committee reviewed the Director Compensation Policy with the aid of Compensia and in light of Tesla‚Äôs\\nexceptional performance and commitment to at-risk director compensation in the form of annual stock option awards to ensure continued alignment of\\nthe interests of directors with those of Tesla‚Äôs stockholders. Following such review, the Compensation Committee recommended that the Board approve\\na resolution that all existing directors forego any automatic grants of annual stock option awards under the Director Compensation Policy or otherwise\\npreviously approved by the Board until July 2022 unless the Board earlier acts to amend the Director Compensation Policy or otherwise amends such\\nresolution. In June 2021, the Board unanimously approved and adopted this resolution and in May 2022, the Board agreed to further forego the Board\\nStock Option Grants until July 2023 unless the Board earlier acts to amend the Director Compensation Policy or otherwise amends such resolution. The\\nCompensation Committee intends to make further recommendations with respect to the Board‚Äôs compensation program for directors, if any, who join the\\nBoard after the date of this resolution, as well as for future periods of service by existing directors, following further periodic reviews.\\nOther Information\\nIf, following a change in control of Tesla, the service of a non-employee director is terminated, all stock options granted to the director shall fully vest\\nand become immediately exercisable.\\nNon-employee directors may also have their travel, lodging and related expenses associated with attending Board or Board committee meetings\\nreimbursed by Tesla.\\nPledging of Shares\\n \\nThe ability of our directors and executive officers to pledge Tesla stock for personal loans and investments is inherently related to their compensation\\ndue to our use of equity awards and promotion of long-termism and an ownership culture. Moreover, providing these individuals flexibility in financial\\nplanning without having to rely on the sale of shares aligns their interests with those of our stockholders.\\nIn order to mitigate the risk of forced sales of pledged shares, the Board has a policy that limits pledging of Tesla stock by our directors and executive\\nofficers. Pursuant to this policy, directors and executive officers may pledge their stock (exclusive of options, warrants, restricted stock units or other\\nrights to purchase stock) as collateral for loans and investments, provided that the maximum aggregate loan or investment amount collateralized by such\\npledged stock does not exceed, (i) with respect to our CEO, the lesser of $3.5 billion or twenty-five percent (25%) of the total value of the pledged\\nstock, or (ii) with respect to our directors and officers other than our CEO, fifteen percent (15%) of the total value of the pledged stock.\\nExample: A director (other than our CEO) pledges 1,000 shares as collateral for a loan, and the current stock price is $800 per share.\\nThe director may borrow up to 15% of 1,000 x $800, or $120,000, against such shares. If the stock price later increases to $1,600 per\\nshare, the director may borrow up to an additional $120,000 against the pledged shares. If the director borrows the full allowable\\namount of $240,000 and the stock price then decreases to $1,200, the director must repay $60,000 to maintain compliance with the 15%\\nlimit under the pledging policy.\\n \\n58    Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement   \\n--- Page 40 ---\\nTable of Contents\\nSee ‚ÄúOwnership of Securities‚Äù below for information regarding any shares pledged by our directors or executive officers as of March 31, 2023;\\nhowever, such pledging does not indicate the extent to which there may be actual borrowings against such shares as of such date, which may be\\nsubstantially less than the value of the shares pledged. As of December 31, 2022, based on written representations of our directors and executive officers\\nto the Company, the aggregate loan or investment amount collateralized by our directors and executive officers‚Äô pledged shares was less than 1% of the\\ntotal value of the pledged shares.\\nWe require our directors and executive officers to make written representations, at least annually, that he or she is in compliance with our pledging\\npolicy. If a director or executive officer wishes to take a loan collateralized by pledged stock, Tesla management works with the director or executive\\nofficer during the original loan approval, and subsequently monitors compliance with this policy by regularly reviewing and requesting updates from the\\napplicable director or executive officer on his or her pledged stock amount and loan amount. If necessary, Tesla management will report to the Board or\\nits committees the extent to which any officer or director has pledged shares of Company stock. We believe that this monitoring is effective and\\nincludes appropriate controls, and we have confirmed that each of our directors and executive officers who have pledged stock are and have been\\ncompliant with this policy since our last confirmation.\\nEquity Compensation Plan Information\\n \\nThe following table summarizes the number of securities underlying outstanding options, stock awards, warrants and rights granted to employees and\\ndirectors, as well as the number of securities remaining available for future issuance, under Tesla‚Äôs equity compensation awards as of December 31,\\n2022.\\n \\n   (a)   (b)    (c)  \\n  Plan category   Number of securities\\nto be issued upon\\nexercise of\\noutstanding\\noptions, warrants\\nand rights\\n(#)(1)   Weighted-average\\nexercise price of\\noutstanding options,\\nwarrants and rights\\n($)(2)    Number of securities\\nremaining available for\\nfuture issuance under\\nequity compensation\\nplans (excluding\\nsecurities reflected in\\ncolumn (a))\\n(#)  \\nEquity compensation plans approved by\\nsecurity holders    364,705,998   30.65    247,886,582(3) \\nEquity compensation plans not approved by\\nsecurity holders    190,915(4)   33.00    ‚Äî \\nTotal    364,896,913   30.65    247,886,582 \\n(1)Consists of options to purchase shares of our common stock, including the 2018 CEO Performance Award, and restricted stock unit awards\\nrepresenting the right to acquire shares of our common stock.\\n(2)The weighted average exercise price is calculated based solely on the outstanding stock options.

      "\n",
      "Based on the provided context, Tesla should address cyber risk through a comprehensive and proactive approach that includes the following key actions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Risk Identification and Disclosure:**  \n",
      "   Tesla should continue to identify and assess cybersecurity threats and disclose any material risks or incidents in its public filings, such as the Annual Report on Form 10-K under the risk factors section. This transparency helps inform investors and stakeholders about potential impacts on business strategy, operations, and financial condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Robust Cybersecurity Governance:**  \n",
      "   Tesla should maintain strong cybersecurity governance, ensuring that policies, procedures, and controls are in place to protect its information technology systems and data, as well as those of its service providers, customers, and users. This includes regular reviews and updates to security protocols to address evolving threats.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Incident Response and Mitigation:**  \n",
      "   Tesla should have a well-defined incident response plan to quickly detect, respond to, and recover from cyber-attacks or security incidents. This plan should minimize the risk of data breaches, intellectual property theft, and other adverse consequences such as litigation, regulatory investigations, and reputational damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Continuous Improvement:**  \n",
      "   As stated in the context, Tesla aspires to \"do the right thing\" and is \"constantly looking for ways to do better.\" This means regularly evaluating and enhancing cybersecurity measures, learning from past incidents, and adopting best practices and new technologies to strengthen defenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Employee Training and Awareness:**  \n",
      "   Tesla should ensure that employees, especially those in critical roles, are trained to recognize and respond to cybersecurity threats. This includes regular security awareness programs and updates on emerging risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Collaboration with Service Providers and Partners:**  \n",
      "   Since risks can also arise from third parties, Tesla should work closely with its service providers, customers, and users to ensure they adhere to strong cybersecurity standards and practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Regulatory Compliance:**  \n",
      "   Tesla should stay informed about and comply with all relevant cybersecurity regulations and reporting requirements, both in the U.S. and internationally.\n",
      "\n",
      "By implementing these measures, Tesla can better manage and mitigate cyber risks, protect its assets and reputation, and maintain the trust of its stakeholders.\n",

      "   - Implement advanced threat detection and response systems (e.g., SIEM, EDR).\n",
      "   - Conduct regular third-party penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.\n",
      "   - Enforce multi-factor authentication and least-privilege access across all systems.\n",
      "3. **Supply Chain & Vendor Risk Management:**\n",
      "   - Require cybersecurity standards and regular audits for all critical suppliers and service providers.\n",
      "4. **Incident Response & Crisis Management:**\n",
      "   - Develop and regularly test a comprehensive incident response plan.\n",
      "   - Establish clear communication protocols for internal and external stakeholders.\n",
      "5. **Employee Training & Awareness:**\n",
      "   - Launch mandatory cybersecurity awareness training for all employees, with specialized training for high-risk roles.\n",
      "6. **Key Person Risk Mitigation:**\n",
      "   - Develop succession and delegation plans to reduce dependency on any single executive for cyber risk oversight.\n",
      "7. **Regulatory Compliance:**\n",
      "   - Ensure ongoing compliance with global data protection and cybersecurity regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).\n",

      "\n",

      "- *Rationale:*  \n",
      "  - The assessment is based on public filings and general disclosures, with limited detail on specific technical controls or incident history.  \n",
      "  - Confidence would be increased with access to internal audit reports, technical security assessments, and incident logs.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Summary:**  \n",
      "Tesla faces significant cyber risk exposure due to its high-profile brand, complex supply chain, and reliance on proprietary technology. While governance and transparency are in place at a high level, there is a need for more robust, formalized cybersecurity controls and oversight. Immediate action is recommended to strengthen technical defenses, governance structures, and incident response capabilities.\n",
